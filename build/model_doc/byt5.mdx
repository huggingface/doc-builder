# ByT5

## Overview

The ByT5 model was presented in [ByT5: Towards a token-free future with pre-trained byte-to-byte models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.13626) by Linting Xue, Aditya Barua, Noah Constant, Rami Al-Rfou, Sharan Narang, Mihir
Kale, Adam Roberts, Colin Raffel.

The abstract from the paper is the following:

*Most widely-used pre-trained language models operate on sequences of tokens corresponding to word or subword units.
Encoding text as a sequence of tokens requires a tokenizer, which is typically created as an independent artifact from
the model. Token-free models that instead operate directly on raw text (bytes or characters) have many benefits: they
can process text in any language out of the box, they are more robust to noise, and they minimize technical debt by
removing complex and error-prone text preprocessing pipelines. Since byte or character sequences are longer than token
sequences, past work on token-free models has often introduced new model architectures designed to amortize the cost of
operating directly on raw text. In this paper, we show that a standard Transformer architecture can be used with
minimal modifications to process byte sequences. We carefully characterize the trade-offs in terms of parameter count,
training FLOPs, and inference speed, and show that byte-level models are competitive with their token-level
counterparts. We also demonstrate that byte-level models are significantly more robust to noise and perform better on
tasks that are sensitive to spelling and pronunciation. As part of our contribution, we release a new set of
pre-trained byte-level Transformer models based on the T5 architecture, as well as all code and data used in our
experiments.*

This model was contributed by [patrickvonplaten](https://huggingface.co/patrickvonplaten). The original code can be
found [here](https://github.com/google-research/byt5).

ByT5's architecture is based on the T5v1.1 model, so one can refer to [T5v1.1's documentation page](t5v1.1.html). They
only differ in how inputs should be prepared for the model, see the code examples below.

Since ByT5 was pre-trained unsupervisedly, there's no real advantage to using a task prefix during single-task
fine-tuning. If you are doing multi-task fine-tuning, you should use a prefix.


### Example

ByT5 works on raw UTF-8 bytes, so it can be used without a tokenizer:

```
from transformers import T5ForConditionalGeneration
import torch

model = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained('google/byt5-small')

input_ids = torch.tensor([list("Life is like a box of chocolates.".encode("utf-8"))]) + 3  # add 3 for special tokens
labels = torch.tensor([list("La vie est comme une boîte de chocolat.".encode("utf-8"))]) + 3  # add 3 for special tokens

loss = model(input_ids, labels=labels).loss # forward pass
```

For batched inference and training it is however recommended to make use of the tokenizer:

```
from transformers import T5ForConditionalGeneration, AutoTokenizer

model = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained('google/byt5-small')
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('google/byt5-small')

model_inputs = tokenizer(["Life is like a box of chocolates.", "Today is Monday."], padding="longest", return_tensors="pt")
labels = tokenizer(["La vie est comme une boîte de chocolat.", "Aujourd'hui c'est lundi."], padding="longest", return_tensors="pt").input_ids

loss = model(**model_inputs, labels=labels).loss # forward pass
```

## ByT5Tokenizer

<a id='transformers.ByT5Tokenizer'></a>
> **class transformers.ByT5Tokenizer**(eos_token = &lcub/s>, unk_token = &lcubunk>, pad_token = &lcubpad>, extra_ids = 125, additional_special_tokens = None, **kwargs)


Construct a ByT5 tokenizer. ByT5 simply uses raw bytes utf-8 encoding.

This tokenizer inherits from [PreTrainedTokenizer](main_classes/tokenizer.html#transformers.PreTrainedTokenizer) which contains most of the main methods.
Users should refer to this superclass for more information regarding those methods.

> Parameters

- **eos_token** (`str`, _optional_, defaults to `"&lcub/s>"`) --
  The end of sequence token.

<Tip>

When building a sequence using special tokens, this is not the token that is used for the end of
sequence. The token used is the `sep_token`.

</Tip>

- **unk_token** (`str`, _optional_, defaults to `"&lcubunk>"`) --
  The unknown token. A token that is not in the vocabulary cannot be converted to an ID and is set to be this
  token instead.
- **pad_token** (`str`, _optional_, defaults to `"&lcubpad>"`) --
  The token used for padding, for example when batching sequences of different lengths.
- **extra_ids** (`int`, _optional_, defaults to 100) --
  Add a number of extra ids added to the end of the vocabulary for use as sentinels. These tokens are
  accessible as "&lcubextra_id_&lcub%d}>" where "&lcub%d}" is a number between 0 and extra_ids-1. Extra tokens are
  indexed from the end of the vocabulary up to beginning ("&lcubextra_id_0>" is the last token in the vocabulary
  like in ByT5 preprocessing see [here](https://github.com/google-research/text-to-text-transfer-transformer/blob/9fd7b14a769417be33bc6c850f9598764913c833/t5/data/preprocessors.py#L2117)).
- **additional_special_tokens** (`List[str]`, _optional_) --
  Additional special tokens used by the tokenizer.


<a id='transformers.ByT5Tokenizer.build_inputs_with_special_tokens'></a>
> **build\_inputs\_with\_special\_tokens**(self, token_ids_0: typing.List[int], token_ids_1: typing.Optional[typing.List[int]] = None)


Build model inputs from a sequence or a pair of sequence for sequence classification tasks by concatenating and
adding special tokens. A sequence has the following format:

- single sequence: `X &lcub/s>`
- pair of sequences: `A &lcub/s> B &lcub/s>`

> Parameters

- **token_ids_0** (`List[int]`) --
  List of IDs to which the special tokens will be added.
- **token_ids_1** (`List[int]`, _optional_) --
  Optional second list of IDs for sequence pairs.

> Returns

List of [input IDs](../glossary.html#input-ids) with the appropriate special tokens.

> Return type

`List[int]`


<a id='transformers.ByT5Tokenizer.convert_tokens_to_string'></a>
> **convert\_tokens\_to\_string**(self, tokens)

Converts a sequence of tokens (string) in a single string.

<a id='transformers.ByT5Tokenizer.create_token_type_ids_from_sequences'></a>
> **create\_token\_type\_ids\_from\_sequences**(self, token_ids_0: typing.List[int], token_ids_1: typing.Optional[typing.List[int]] = None)


Create a mask from the two sequences passed to be used in a sequence-pair classification task. ByT5 does not
make use of token type ids, therefore a list of zeros is returned.

> Parameters

- **token_ids_0** (`List[int]`) --
  List of IDs.
- **token_ids_1** (`List[int]`, _optional_) --
  Optional second list of IDs for sequence pairs.

> Returns

List of zeros.

> Return type

`List[int]`


<a id='transformers.ByT5Tokenizer.get_special_tokens_mask'></a>
> **get\_special\_tokens\_mask**(self, token_ids_0: typing.List[int], token_ids_1: typing.Optional[typing.List[int]] = None, already_has_special_tokens: bool = False)


Retrieve sequence ids from a token list that has no special tokens added. This method is called when adding
special tokens using the tokenizer `prepare_for_model` method.

> Parameters

- **token_ids_0** (`List[int]`) --
  List of IDs.
- **token_ids_1** (`List[int]`, _optional_) --
  Optional second list of IDs for sequence pairs.
- **already_has_special_tokens** (`bool`, _optional_, defaults to `False`) --
  Whether or not the token list is already formatted with special tokens for the model.

> Returns

A list of integers in the range [0, 1]: 1 for a special token, 0 for a sequence token.

> Return type

`List[int]`
