# ELECTRA

## Overview

The ELECTRA model was proposed in the paper [ELECTRA: Pre-training Text Encoders as Discriminators Rather Than
Generators](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=r1xMH1BtvB). ELECTRA is a new pretraining approach which trains two
transformer models: the generator and the discriminator. The generator's role is to replace tokens in a sequence, and
is therefore trained as a masked language model. The discriminator, which is the model we're interested in, tries to
identify which tokens were replaced by the generator in the sequence.

The abstract from the paper is the following:

*Masked language modeling (MLM) pretraining methods such as BERT corrupt the input by replacing some tokens with [MASK]
and then train a model to reconstruct the original tokens. While they produce good results when transferred to
downstream NLP tasks, they generally require large amounts of compute to be effective. As an alternative, we propose a
more sample-efficient pretraining task called replaced token detection. Instead of masking the input, our approach
corrupts it by replacing some tokens with plausible alternatives sampled from a small generator network. Then, instead
of training a model that predicts the original identities of the corrupted tokens, we train a discriminative model that
predicts whether each token in the corrupted input was replaced by a generator sample or not. Thorough experiments
demonstrate this new pretraining task is more efficient than MLM because the task is defined over all input tokens
rather than just the small subset that was masked out. As a result, the contextual representations learned by our
approach substantially outperform the ones learned by BERT given the same model size, data, and compute. The gains are
particularly strong for small models; for example, we train a model on one GPU for 4 days that outperforms GPT (trained
using 30x more compute) on the GLUE natural language understanding benchmark. Our approach also works well at scale,
where it performs comparably to RoBERTa and XLNet while using less than 1/4 of their compute and outperforms them when
using the same amount of compute.*

Tips:

- ELECTRA is the pretraining approach, therefore there is nearly no changes done to the underlying model: BERT. The
  only change is the separation of the embedding size and the hidden size: the embedding size is generally smaller,
  while the hidden size is larger. An additional projection layer (linear) is used to project the embeddings from their
  embedding size to the hidden size. In the case where the embedding size is the same as the hidden size, no projection
  layer is used.
- The ELECTRA checkpoints saved using [Google Research's implementation](https://github.com/google-research/electra)
  contain both the generator and discriminator. The conversion script requires the user to name which model to export
  into the correct architecture. Once converted to the HuggingFace format, these checkpoints may be loaded into all
  available ELECTRA models, however. This means that the discriminator may be loaded in the
  [ElectraForMaskedLM](model_doc/electra.html#transformers.ElectraForMaskedLM) model, and the generator may be loaded in the
  [ElectraForPreTraining](model_doc/electra.html#transformers.ElectraForPreTraining) model (the classification head will be randomly initialized as it
  doesn't exist in the generator).

This model was contributed by [lysandre](https://huggingface.co/lysandre). The original code can be found [here](https://github.com/google-research/electra).

configuration to that of the ELECTRA [google/electra-small-discriminator](https://huggingface.co/google/electra-small-discriminator) architecture.

Configuration objects inherit from [PretrainedConfig](main_classes/configuration.html#transformers.PretrainedConfig) and can be used to control the model

## ElectraModel

<a id='transformers.ElectraModel'></a>
> **class transformers.ElectraModel**(config)

The bare Electra Model transformer outputting raw hidden-states without any specific head on top. Identical to the BERT model except that it uses an additional linear layer between the embedding layer and the encoder if the hidden size and embedding size are different. Both the generator and discriminator checkpoints may be loaded into this model.

This model inherits from [PreTrainedModel](main_classes/model.html#transformers.PreTrainedModel). Check the superclass documentation for the generic
methods the library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input embeddings,
pruning heads etc.)

This model is also a PyTorch [torch.nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module)

general usage and behavior.

> Parameters

  Initializing with a config file does not load the weights associated with the model, only the

`Module` instance afterwards instead of this since the former takes care of running the pre and post
processing steps while the latter silently ignores them.

## ElectraForMaskedLM

<a id='transformers.ElectraForMaskedLM'></a>
> **class transformers.ElectraForMaskedLM**(config)


Electra model with a language modeling head on top.

Even though both the discriminator and generator may be loaded into this model, the generator is the only model of
the two to have been trained for the masked language modeling task.


This model inherits from [PreTrainedModel](main_classes/model.html#transformers.PreTrainedModel). Check the superclass documentation for the generic
methods the library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input embeddings,
pruning heads etc.)

This model is also a PyTorch [torch.nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module)
subclass. Use it as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to
general usage and behavior.

> Parameters

  Initializing with a config file does not load the weights associated with the model, only the
  configuration. Check out the [from_pretrained()](main_classes/model.html#transformers.PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained) method to load the model
  weights.

## ElectraForQuestionAnswering

<a id='transformers.ElectraForQuestionAnswering'></a>
> **class transformers.ElectraForQuestionAnswering**(config)


ELECTRA Model with a span classification head on top for extractive question-answering tasks like SQuAD (a linear
layers on top of the hidden-states output to compute _span start logits_ and _span end logits_).


This model inherits from [PreTrainedModel](main_classes/model.html#transformers.PreTrainedModel). Check the superclass documentation for the generic
methods the library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input embeddings,
pruning heads etc.)

This model is also a PyTorch [torch.nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module)
subclass. Use it as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to
general usage and behavior.

> Parameters

- **config** ([ElectraConfig](model_doc/electra.html#transformers.ElectraConfig)) -- Model configuration class with all the parameters of the model.
  Initializing with a config file does not load the weights associated with the model, only the
  configuration. Check out the [from_pretrained()](main_classes/model.html#transformers.PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained) method to load the model
  weights.


<a id='transformers.ElectraForQuestionAnswering.forward'></a>

Although the recipe for forward pass needs to be defined within this function, one should call the
`Module` instance afterwards instead of this since the former takes care of running the pre and post
processing steps while the latter silently ignores them.

## TFElectraModel

<a id='transformers.TFElectraModel'></a>
> **class transformers.TFElectraModel**(*args, **kwargs)

The bare Electra Model transformer outputting raw hidden-states without any specific head on top. Identical to the BERT model except that it uses an additional linear layer between the embedding layer and the encoder if the hidden size and embedding size are different. Both the generator and discriminator checkpoints may be loaded into this model.

This model inherits from [TFPreTrainedModel](main_classes/model.html#transformers.TFPreTrainedModel). Check the superclass documentation for the
generic methods the library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input
embeddings, pruning heads etc.)

This model is also a [tf.keras.Model](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/Model) subclass. Use
it as a regular TF 2.0 Keras Model and refer to the TF 2.0 documentation for all matter related to general usage
and behavior.

<Tip>

TF 2.0 models accepts two formats as inputs:

- having all inputs as keyword arguments (like PyTorch models), or
- having all inputs as a list, tuple or dict in the first positional arguments.

This second option is useful when using `tf.keras.Model.fit` method which currently requires having all
the tensors in the first argument of the model call function: `model(inputs)`.

If you choose this second option, there are three possibilities you can use to gather all the input Tensors in
the first positional argument :

- a single Tensor with `input_ids` only and nothing else: `model(inputs_ids)`
- a list of varying length with one or several input Tensors IN THE ORDER given in the docstring:
  `model([input_ids, attention_mask])` or `model([input_ids, attention_mask, token_type_ids])`
- a dictionary with one or several input Tensors associated to the input names given in the docstring:
  `model(&lcub"input_ids": input_ids, "token_type_ids": token_type_ids})`

</Tip>

> Parameters

- **config** ([ElectraConfig](model_doc/electra.html#transformers.ElectraConfig)) -- Model configuration class with all the parameters of the model.
  Initializing with a config file does not load the weights associated with the model, only the
  configuration. Check out the [from_pretrained()](main_classes/model.html#transformers.PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained) method to load the model

and behavior.

<Tip>

TF 2.0 models accepts two formats as inputs:

- having all inputs as keyword arguments (like PyTorch models), or
- having all inputs as a list, tuple or dict in the first positional arguments.

This second option is useful when using `tf.keras.Model.fit` method which currently requires having all
the tensors in the first argument of the model call function: `model(inputs)`.

If you choose this second option, there are three possibilities you can use to gather all the input Tensors in
the first positional argument :

- a single Tensor with `input_ids` only and nothing else: `model(inputs_ids)`
- a list of varying length with one or several input Tensors IN THE ORDER given in the docstring:
  `model([input_ids, attention_mask])` or `model([input_ids, attention_mask, token_type_ids])`
- a dictionary with one or several input Tensors associated to the input names given in the docstring:
  `model(&lcub"input_ids": input_ids, "token_type_ids": token_type_ids})`

</Tip>

> Parameters

- **config** ([ElectraConfig](model_doc/electra.html#transformers.ElectraConfig)) -- Model configuration class with all the parameters of the model.
  Initializing with a config file does not load the weights associated with the model, only the
  configuration. Check out the [from_pretrained()](main_classes/model.html#transformers.PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained) method to load the model
  weights.

The [TFElectraForMaskedLM](model_doc/electra.html#transformers.TFElectraForMaskedLM) forward method, overrides the `__call__` special method.

<Tip>

Although the recipe for forward pass needs to be defined within this function, one should call the
`Module` instance afterwards instead of this since the former takes care of running the pre and post
processing steps while the latter silently ignores them.

</Tip>

> Parameters

  vectors than the model's internal embedding lookup matrix.
- **output_attentions** (`bool`, _optional_) --
  Whether or not to return the attentions tensors of all attention layers. See `attentions` under returned
  tensors for more detail. This argument can be used only in eager mode, in graph mode the value in the

## TFElectraForQuestionAnswering

<a id='transformers.TFElectraForQuestionAnswering'></a>
> **class transformers.TFElectraForQuestionAnswering**(*args, **kwargs)


Electra Model with a span classification head on top for extractive question-answering tasks like SQuAD (a linear
layers on top of the hidden-states output to compute _span start logits_ and _span end logits_).


This model inherits from [TFPreTrainedModel](main_classes/model.html#transformers.TFPreTrainedModel). Check the superclass documentation for the
generic methods the library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input
embeddings, pruning heads etc.)

This model is also a [tf.keras.Model](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/Model) subclass. Use
it as a regular TF 2.0 Keras Model and refer to the TF 2.0 documentation for all matter related to general usage
and behavior.

<Tip>

TF 2.0 models accepts two formats as inputs:

- having all inputs as keyword arguments (like PyTorch models), or
- having all inputs as a list, tuple or dict in the first positional arguments.

This second option is useful when using `tf.keras.Model.fit` method which currently requires having all
the tensors in the first argument of the model call function: `model(inputs)`.

If you choose this second option, there are three possibilities you can use to gather all the input Tensors in
the first positional argument :

- a single Tensor with `input_ids` only and nothing else: `model(inputs_ids)`
- a list of varying length with one or several input Tensors IN THE ORDER given in the docstring:
  `model([input_ids, attention_mask])` or `model([input_ids, attention_mask, token_type_ids])`
- a dictionary with one or several input Tensors associated to the input names given in the docstring:
  `model(&lcub"input_ids": input_ids, "token_type_ids": token_type_ids})`

</Tip>

> Parameters

- **config** ([ElectraConfig](model_doc/electra.html#transformers.ElectraConfig)) -- Model configuration class with all the parameters of the model.
  Initializing with a config file does not load the weights associated with the model, only the
  configuration. Check out the [from_pretrained()](main_classes/model.html#transformers.PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained) method to load the model
  weights.

Electra Model transformer with a sequence classification/regression head on top (a linear layer on top of the
pooled output) e.g. for GLUE tasks.


This model inherits from [FlaxPreTrainedModel](main_classes/model.html#transformers.FlaxPreTrainedModel). Check the superclass documentation for the
generic methods the library implements for all its model (such as downloading, saving and converting weights from
PyTorch models)

This model is also a Flax Linen [flax.nn.Module](https://flax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_autosummary/flax.nn.module.html) subclass. Use it as a regular Flax
Module and refer to the Flax documentation for all matter related to general usage and behavior.

Finally, this model supports inherent JAX features such as:

- [Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jax.html#just-in-time-compilation-jit)
- [Automatic Differentiation](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jax.html#automatic-differentiation)
- [Vectorization](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jax.html#vectorization-vmap)
- [Parallelization](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jax.html#parallelization-pmap)

> Parameters

- **config** ([ElectraConfig](model_doc/electra.html#transformers.ElectraConfig)) -- Model configuration class with all the parameters of the model.
  Initializing with a config file does not load the weights associated with the model, only the
  configuration. Check out the [from_pretrained()](main_classes/model.html#transformers.PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained) method to load the model
  weights.
