# TAPAS

<Tip>

This is a recently introduced model so the API hasn't been tested extensively. There may be some bugs or slight
breaking changes to fix them in the future.

</Tip>

## Overview

The TAPAS model was proposed in [TAPAS: Weakly Supervised Table Parsing via Pre-training](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-main.398) by Jonathan Herzig, Paweł Krzysztof Nowak, Thomas Müller,
Francesco Piccinno and Julian Martin Eisenschlos. It's a BERT-based model specifically designed (and pre-trained) for
answering questions about tabular data. Compared to BERT, TAPAS uses relative position embeddings and has 7 token types
that encode tabular structure. TAPAS is pre-trained on the masked language modeling (MLM) objective on a large dataset
comprising millions of tables from English Wikipedia and corresponding texts. For question answering, TAPAS has 2 heads
on top: a cell selection head and an aggregation head, for (optionally) performing aggregations (such as counting or
summing) among selected cells. TAPAS has been fine-tuned on several datasets: [SQA](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=54253) (Sequential Question Answering by Microsoft), [WTQ](https://github.com/ppasupat/WikiTableQuestions) (Wiki Table Questions by Stanford University) and [WikiSQL](https://github.com/salesforce/WikiSQL) (by Salesforce). It achieves state-of-the-art on both SQA and WTQ, while
having comparable performance to SOTA on WikiSQL, with a much simpler architecture.

The abstract from the paper is the following:

*Answering natural language questions over tables is usually seen as a semantic parsing task. To alleviate the
collection cost of full logical forms, one popular approach focuses on weak supervision consisting of denotations
instead of logical forms. However, training semantic parsers from weak supervision poses difficulties, and in addition,
the generated logical forms are only used as an intermediate step prior to retrieving the denotation. In this paper, we
present TAPAS, an approach to question answering over tables without generating logical forms. TAPAS trains from weak
supervision, and predicts the denotation by selecting table cells and optionally applying a corresponding aggregation
operator to such selection. TAPAS extends BERT's architecture to encode tables as input, initializes from an effective
joint pre-training of text segments and tables crawled from Wikipedia, and is trained end-to-end. We experiment with
three different semantic parsing datasets, and find that TAPAS outperforms or rivals semantic parsing models by
improving state-of-the-art accuracy on SQA from 55.1 to 67.2 and performing on par with the state-of-the-art on WIKISQL
and WIKITQ, but with a simpler model architecture. We additionally find that transfer learning, which is trivial in our
setting, from WIKISQL to WIKITQ, yields 48.7 accuracy, 4.2 points above the state-of-the-art.*

In addition, the authors have further pre-trained TAPAS to recognize **table entailment**, by creating a balanced
dataset of millions of automatically created training examples which are learned in an intermediate step prior to
fine-tuning. The authors of TAPAS call this further pre-training intermediate pre-training (since TAPAS is first
pre-trained on MLM, and then on another dataset). They found that intermediate pre-training further improves
performance on SQA, achieving a new state-of-the-art as well as state-of-the-art on [TabFact](https://github.com/wenhuchen/Table-Fact-Checking), a large-scale dataset with 16k Wikipedia tables for table
entailment (a binary classification task). For more details, see their follow-up paper: [Understanding tables with
intermediate pre-training](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.findings-emnlp.27/) by Julian Martin Eisenschlos,
Syrine Krichene and Thomas Müller.

This model was contributed by [nielsr](https://huggingface.co/nielsr). The original code can be found [here](https://github.com/google-research/tapas).

Tips:

- TAPAS is a model that uses relative position embeddings by default (restarting the position embeddings at every cell
  of the table). Note that this is something that was added after the publication of the original TAPAS paper.
  According to the authors, this usually results in a slightly better performance, and allows you to encode longer
  sequences without running out of embeddings. This is reflected in the `reset_position_index_per_cell` parameter of
  [TapasConfig](model_doc/tapas.html#transformers.TapasConfig), which is set to `True` by default. The default versions of the models available
  in the [model hub](https://huggingface.co/models?search=tapas) all use relative position embeddings. You can still
  use the ones with absolute position embeddings by passing in an additional argument `revision="no_reset"` when
  calling the `.from_pretrained()` method. Note that it's usually advised to pad the inputs on the right rather than
  the left.
- TAPAS is based on BERT, so `TAPAS-base` for example corresponds to a `BERT-base` architecture. Of course,
  TAPAS-large will result in the best performance (the results reported in the paper are from TAPAS-large). Results of
  the various sized models are shown on the [original Github repository](https://github.com/google-research/tapas).
- TAPAS has checkpoints fine-tuned on SQA, which are capable of answering questions related to a table in a
  conversational set-up. This means that you can ask follow-up questions such as "what is his age?" related to the
  previous question. Note that the forward pass of TAPAS is a bit different in case of a conversational set-up: in that
  case, you have to feed every table-question pair one by one to the model, such that the _prev_labels_ token type ids
  can be overwritten by the predicted _labels_ of the model to the previous question. See "Usage" section for more
  info.
- TAPAS is similar to BERT and therefore relies on the masked language modeling (MLM) objective. It is therefore
  efficient at predicting masked tokens and at NLU in general, but is not optimal for text generation. Models trained
  with a causal language modeling (CLM) objective are better in that regard.


## Usage: fine-tuning

Here we explain how you can fine-tune [TapasForQuestionAnswering](model_doc/tapas.html#transformers.TapasForQuestionAnswering) on your own dataset.

**STEP 1: Choose one of the 3 ways in which you can use TAPAS - or experiment**

Basically, there are 3 different ways in which one can fine-tune [TapasForQuestionAnswering](model_doc/tapas.html#transformers.TapasForQuestionAnswering),
corresponding to the different datasets on which Tapas was fine-tuned:

1. SQA: if you're interested in asking follow-up questions related to a table, in a conversational set-up. For example
   if you first ask "what's the name of the first actor?" then you can ask a follow-up question such as "how old is
   he?". Here, questions do not involve any aggregation (all questions are cell selection questions).
2. WTQ: if you're not interested in asking questions in a conversational set-up, but rather just asking questions
   related to a table, which might involve aggregation, such as counting a number of rows, summing up cell values or
   averaging cell values. You can then for example ask "what's the total number of goals Cristiano Ronaldo made in his
   career?". This case is also called **weak supervision**, since the model itself must learn the appropriate
   aggregation operator (SUM/COUNT/AVERAGE/NONE) given only the answer to the question as supervision.
3. WikiSQL-supervised: this dataset is based on WikiSQL with the model being given the ground truth aggregation
   operator during training. This is also called **strong supervision**. Here, learning the appropriate aggregation
   operator is much easier.

To summarize:

| **Task**                           | **Example dataset**  | **Description**                                                                                                   |
| Conversational                     | SQA                  | Conversational, only cell selection questions                                                                     |
| Weak supervision for aggregation   | WTQ                  | Questions might involve aggregation, and the model must learn this given only the answer as supervision           |
| Strong supervision for aggregation | WikiSQL-supervised   | Questions might involve aggregation, and the model must learn this given the gold aggregation operator            |

Initializing a model with a pre-trained base and randomly initialized classification heads from the model hub can be
done as follows (be sure to have installed the [torch-scatter dependency](https://github.com/rusty1s/pytorch_scatter)
for your environment):

```
>>> from transformers import TapasConfig, TapasForQuestionAnswering

>>> # for example, the base sized model with default SQA configuration
>>> model = TapasForQuestionAnswering.from_pretrained('google/tapas-base')

>>> # or, the base sized model with WTQ configuration
>>> config = TapasConfig.from_pretrained('google/tapas-base-finetuned-wtq')
>>> model = TapasForQuestionAnswering.from_pretrained('google/tapas-base', config=config)

>>> # or, the base sized model with WikiSQL configuration
>>> config = TapasConfig('google-base-finetuned-wikisql-supervised')
>>> model = TapasForQuestionAnswering.from_pretrained('google/tapas-base', config=config)
```

Of course, you don't necessarily have to follow one of these three ways in which TAPAS was fine-tuned. You can also
experiment by defining any hyperparameters you want when initializing [TapasConfig](model_doc/tapas.html#transformers.TapasConfig), and then
create a [TapasForQuestionAnswering](model_doc/tapas.html#transformers.TapasForQuestionAnswering) based on that configuration. For example, if you have a
dataset that has both conversational questions and questions that might involve aggregation, then you can do it this
way. Here's an example:

```
>>> from transformers import TapasConfig, TapasForQuestionAnswering

>>> # you can initialize the classification heads any way you want (see docs of TapasConfig)
>>> config = TapasConfig(num_aggregation_labels=3, average_logits_per_cell=True, select_one_column=False)
>>> # initializing the pre-trained base sized model with our custom classification heads
>>> model = TapasForQuestionAnswering.from_pretrained('google/tapas-base', config=config)
```

What you can also do is start from an already fine-tuned checkpoint. A note here is that the already fine-tuned
checkpoint on WTQ has some issues due to the L2-loss which is somewhat brittle. See [here](https://github.com/google-research/tapas/issues/91#issuecomment-735719340) for more info.

For a list of all pre-trained and fine-tuned TAPAS checkpoints available in the HuggingFace model hub, see [here](https://huggingface.co/models?search=tapas).

**STEP 2: Prepare your data in the SQA format**

Second, no matter what you picked above, you should prepare your dataset in the [SQA format](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=54253). This format is a TSV/CSV file with the following
columns:

- `id`: optional, id of the table-question pair, for bookkeeping purposes.
- `annotator`: optional, id of the person who annotated the table-question pair, for bookkeeping purposes.
- `position`: integer indicating if the question is the first, second, third,... related to the table. Only required
  in case of conversational setup (SQA). You don't need this column in case you're going for WTQ/WikiSQL-supervised.
- `question`: string
- `table_file`: string, name of a csv file containing the tabular data
- `answer_coordinates`: list of one or more tuples (each tuple being a cell coordinate, i.e. row, column pair that is
  part of the answer)
- `answer_text`: list of one or more strings (each string being a cell value that is part of the answer)
- `aggregation_label`: index of the aggregation operator. Only required in case of strong supervision for aggregation
  (the WikiSQL-supervised case)
- `float_answer`: the float answer to the question, if there is one (np.nan if there isn't). Only required in case of
  weak supervision for aggregation (such as WTQ and WikiSQL)

The tables themselves should be present in a folder, each table being a separate csv file. Note that the authors of the
TAPAS algorithm used conversion scripts with some automated logic to convert the other datasets (WTQ, WikiSQL) into the
SQA format. The author explains this [here](https://github.com/google-research/tapas/issues/50#issuecomment-705465960). Interestingly, these conversion scripts
are not perfect (the `answer_coordinates` and `float_answer` fields are populated based on the `answer_text`),
meaning that WTQ and WikiSQL results could actually be improved.

**STEP 3: Convert your data into PyTorch tensors using TapasTokenizer**

Third, given that you've prepared your data in this TSV/CSV format (and corresponding CSV files containing the tabular
data), you can then use [TapasTokenizer](model_doc/tapas.html#transformers.TapasTokenizer) to convert table-question pairs into `input_ids`,
`attention_mask`, `token_type_ids` and so on. Again, based on which of the three cases you picked above,
[TapasForQuestionAnswering](model_doc/tapas.html#transformers.TapasForQuestionAnswering) requires different inputs to be fine-tuned:

| **Task**                           | **Required inputs**                                                                          |
| Conversational                     | `input_ids`, `attention_mask`, `token_type_ids`, `labels`                            |
| Weak supervision for aggregation   | `input_ids`, `attention_mask`, `token_type_ids`, `labels`, `numeric_values`,       |
|                                    | `numeric_values_scale`, `float_answer`                                                   |
| Strong supervision for aggregation | `input ids`, `attention mask`, `token type ids`, `labels`, `aggregation_labels`    |

[TapasTokenizer](model_doc/tapas.html#transformers.TapasTokenizer) creates the `labels`, `numeric_values` and `numeric_values_scale` based on
the `answer_coordinates` and `answer_text` columns of the TSV file. The `float_answer` and `aggregation_labels`
are already in the TSV file of step 2. Here's an example:

```
>>> from transformers import TapasTokenizer
>>> import pandas as pd

>>> model_name = 'google/tapas-base'
>>> tokenizer = TapasTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)

>>> data = {'Actors': ["Brad Pitt", "Leonardo Di Caprio", "George Clooney"], 'Number of movies': ["87", "53", "69"]}
>>> queries = ["What is the name of the first actor?", "How many movies has George Clooney played in?", "What is the total number of movies?"]
>>> answer_coordinates = [[(0, 0)], [(2, 1)], [(0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1)]]
>>> answer_text = [["Brad Pitt"], ["69"], ["209"]]
>>> table = pd.DataFrame.from_dict(data)
>>> inputs = tokenizer(table=table, queries=queries, answer_coordinates=answer_coordinates, answer_text=answer_text, padding='max_length', return_tensors='pt')
>>> inputs
{'input_ids': tensor([[ ... ]]), 'attention_mask': tensor([[...]]), 'token_type_ids': tensor([[[...]]]),
'numeric_values': tensor([[ ... ]]), 'numeric_values_scale: tensor([[ ... ]]), labels: tensor([[ ... ]])}
```

Note that [TapasTokenizer](model_doc/tapas.html#transformers.TapasTokenizer) expects the data of the table to be **text-only**. You can use
`.astype(str)` on a dataframe to turn it into text-only data. Of course, this only shows how to encode a single
training example. It is advised to create a PyTorch dataset and a corresponding dataloader:

```
>>> import torch
>>> import pandas as pd

>>> tsv_path = "your_path_to_the_tsv_file"
>>> table_csv_path = "your_path_to_a_directory_containing_all_csv_files"

>>> class TableDataset(torch.utils.data.Dataset):
...     def __init__(self, data, tokenizer):
...         self.data = data
...         self.tokenizer = tokenizer
...
...     def __getitem__(self, idx):
...         item = data.iloc[idx]
...         table = pd.read_csv(table_csv_path + item.table_file).astype(str) # be sure to make your table data text only
...         encoding = self.tokenizer(table=table, 
...                                   queries=item.question, 
...                                   answer_coordinates=item.answer_coordinates, 
...                                   answer_text=item.answer_text,
...                                   truncation=True,
...                                   padding="max_length",
...                                   return_tensors="pt"
...         )
...         # remove the batch dimension which the tokenizer adds by default
...         encoding = {key: val.squeeze(0) for key, val in encoding.items()}
...         # add the float_answer which is also required (weak supervision for aggregation case)
...         encoding["float_answer"] = torch.tensor(item.float_answer) 
...         return encoding
...
...     def __len__(self):
...        return len(self.data)

>>> data = pd.read_csv(tsv_path, sep='\t')
>>> train_dataset = TableDataset(data, tokenizer)
>>> train_dataloader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(train_dataset, batch_size=32)
```

Note that here, we encode each table-question pair independently. This is fine as long as your dataset is **not
conversational**. In case your dataset involves conversational questions (such as in SQA), then you should first group
together the `queries`, `answer_coordinates` and `answer_text` per table (in the order of their `position`
index) and batch encode each table with its questions. This will make sure that the `prev_labels` token types (see
docs of [TapasTokenizer](model_doc/tapas.html#transformers.TapasTokenizer)) are set correctly. See [this notebook](https://github.com/NielsRogge/Transformers-Tutorials/blob/master/TAPAS/Fine_tuning_TapasForQuestionAnswering_on_SQA.ipynb)
for more info.

**STEP 4: Train (fine-tune) TapasForQuestionAnswering**

You can then fine-tune [TapasForQuestionAnswering](model_doc/tapas.html#transformers.TapasForQuestionAnswering) using native PyTorch as follows (shown here for
the weak supervision for aggregation case):

```
>>> from transformers import TapasConfig, TapasForQuestionAnswering, AdamW

>>> # this is the default WTQ configuration
>>> config = TapasConfig(
...            num_aggregation_labels = 4,
...            use_answer_as_supervision = True,
...            answer_loss_cutoff = 0.664694,
...            cell_selection_preference = 0.207951,
...            huber_loss_delta = 0.121194,
...            init_cell_selection_weights_to_zero = True,
...            select_one_column = True,
...            allow_empty_column_selection = False,
...            temperature = 0.0352513,
... )
>>> model = TapasForQuestionAnswering.from_pretrained("google/tapas-base", config=config)

>>> optimizer = AdamW(model.parameters(), lr=5e-5)

>>> for epoch in range(2):  # loop over the dataset multiple times
...    for idx, batch in enumerate(train_dataloader):
...         # get the inputs; 
...         input_ids = batch["input_ids"]
...         attention_mask = batch["attention_mask"]
...         token_type_ids = batch["token_type_ids"]
...         labels = batch["labels"]
...         numeric_values = batch["numeric_values"]
...         numeric_values_scale = batch["numeric_values_scale"]
...         float_answer = batch["float_answer"]

...         # zero the parameter gradients
...         optimizer.zero_grad()

...         # forward + backward + optimize
...         outputs = model(input_ids=input_ids, attention_mask=attention_mask, token_type_ids=token_type_ids, 
...                        labels=labels, numeric_values=numeric_values, numeric_values_scale=numeric_values_scale, 
...                        float_answer=float_answer)
...         loss = outputs.loss
...         loss.backward()
...         optimizer.step()
```

## Usage: inference

Here we explain how you can use [TapasForQuestionAnswering](model_doc/tapas.html#transformers.TapasForQuestionAnswering) for inference (i.e. making predictions
on new data). For inference, only `input_ids`, `attention_mask` and `token_type_ids` (which you can obtain using
[TapasTokenizer](model_doc/tapas.html#transformers.TapasTokenizer)) have to be provided to the model to obtain the logits. Next, you can use the
handy `convert_logits_to_predictions` method of [TapasTokenizer](model_doc/tapas.html#transformers.TapasTokenizer) to convert these into predicted
coordinates and optional aggregation indices.

However, note that inference is **different** depending on whether or not the setup is conversational. In a
non-conversational set-up, inference can be done in parallel on all table-question pairs of a batch. Here's an example
of that:

```
>>> from transformers import TapasTokenizer, TapasForQuestionAnswering
>>> import pandas as pd 

>>> model_name = 'google/tapas-base-finetuned-wtq'
>>> model = TapasForQuestionAnswering.from_pretrained(model_name)
>>> tokenizer = TapasTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)

>>> data = {'Actors': ["Brad Pitt", "Leonardo Di Caprio", "George Clooney"], 'Number of movies': ["87", "53", "69"]}
>>> queries = ["What is the name of the first actor?", "How many movies has George Clooney played in?", "What is the total number of movies?"]
>>> table = pd.DataFrame.from_dict(data)
>>> inputs = tokenizer(table=table, queries=queries, padding='max_length', return_tensors="pt") 
>>> outputs = model(**inputs)
>>> predicted_answer_coordinates, predicted_aggregation_indices = tokenizer.convert_logits_to_predictions(
...         inputs, 
...         outputs.logits.detach(), 
...         outputs.logits_aggregation.detach()
... )

>>> # let's print out the results:
>>> id2aggregation = {0: "NONE", 1: "SUM", 2: "AVERAGE", 3:"COUNT"}
>>> aggregation_predictions_string = [id2aggregation[x] for x in predicted_aggregation_indices]

>>> answers = []
>>> for coordinates in predicted_answer_coordinates:
...   if len(coordinates) == 1:
...     # only a single cell:
...     answers.append(table.iat[coordinates[0]])
...   else:
...     # multiple cells
...     cell_values = []
...     for coordinate in coordinates:
...        cell_values.append(table.iat[coordinate])
...     answers.append(", ".join(cell_values))

>>> display(table)
>>> print("")
>>> for query, answer, predicted_agg in zip(queries, answers, aggregation_predictions_string):
...   print(query)
...   if predicted_agg == "NONE":
...     print("Predicted answer: " + answer)
...   else:
...     print("Predicted answer: " + predicted_agg + " > " + answer)    
What is the name of the first actor?
Predicted answer: Brad Pitt
How many movies has George Clooney played in?
Predicted answer: COUNT > 69
What is the total number of movies?
Predicted answer: SUM > 87, 53, 69
```

In case of a conversational set-up, then each table-question pair must be provided **sequentially** to the model, such
that the `prev_labels` token types can be overwritten by the predicted `labels` of the previous table-question
pair. Again, more info can be found in [this notebook](https://github.com/NielsRogge/Transformers-Tutorials/blob/master/TAPAS/Fine_tuning_TapasForQuestionAnswering_on_SQA.ipynb).

This is the configuration class to store the configuration of a [TapasModel](model_doc/tapas.html#transformers.TapasModel). It is used to
instantiate a TAPAS model according to the specified arguments, defining the model architecture. Instantiating a
configuration with the defaults will yield a similar configuration to that of the TAPAS _tapas-base-finetuned-sqa_
architecture. Configuration objects inherit from `PreTrainedConfig` and can be used to control
the model outputs. Read the documentation from [PretrainedConfig](main_classes/configuration.html#transformers.PretrainedConfig) for more information.

Hyperparameters additional to BERT are taken from run_task_main.py and hparam_utils.py of the original
implementation. Original implementation available at https://github.com/google-research/tapas/tree/master.

  should be set to 0 for these models.

## TapasTokenizer

<a id='transformers.TapasTokenizer'></a>
> **class transformers.TapasTokenizer**(vocab_file, do_lower_case = True, do_basic_tokenize = True, never_split = None, unk_token = [UNK], sep_token = [SEP], pad_token = [PAD], cls_token = [CLS], mask_token = [MASK], empty_token = [EMPTY], tokenize_chinese_chars = True, strip_accents = None, cell_trim_length: int = -1, max_column_id: int = None, max_row_id: int = None, strip_column_names: bool = False, update_answer_coordinates: bool = False, min_question_length = None, max_question_length = None, model_max_length: int = 512, additional_special_tokens: typing.Optional[typing.List[str]] = None, **kwargs)


Construct a TAPAS tokenizer. Based on WordPiece. Flattens a table and one or more related sentences to be used by
TAPAS models.

This tokenizer inherits from [PreTrainedTokenizer](main_classes/tokenizer.html#transformers.PreTrainedTokenizer) which contains most of the main methods.
Users should refer to this superclass for more information regarding those methods.
[TapasTokenizer](model_doc/tapas.html#transformers.TapasTokenizer) creates several token type ids to encode tabular structure. To be more
precise, it adds 7 token type ids, in the following order: `segment_ids`, `column_ids`, `row_ids`,
`prev_labels`, `column_ranks`, `inv_column_ranks` and `numeric_relations`:

- segment_ids: indicate whether a token belongs to the question (0) or the table (1). 0 for special tokens and
  padding.
- column_ids: indicate to which column of the table a token belongs (starting from 1). Is 0 for all question
  tokens, special tokens and padding.
- row_ids: indicate to which row of the table a token belongs (starting from 1). Is 0 for all question tokens,
  special tokens and padding. Tokens of column headers are also 0.
- prev_labels: indicate whether a token was (part of) an answer to the previous question (1) or not (0). Useful in
  a conversational setup (such as SQA).
- column_ranks: indicate the rank of a table token relative to a column, if applicable. For example, if you have a
  column "number of movies" with values 87, 53 and 69, then the column ranks of these tokens are 3, 1 and 2
  respectively. 0 for all question tokens, special tokens and padding.
- inv_column_ranks: indicate the inverse rank of a table token relative to a column, if applicable. For example, if
  you have a column "number of movies" with values 87, 53 and 69, then the inverse column ranks of these tokens are
  1, 3 and 2 respectively. 0 for all question tokens, special tokens and padding.
- numeric_relations: indicate numeric relations between the question and the tokens of the table. 0 for all
  question tokens, special tokens and padding.

[TapasTokenizer](model_doc/tapas.html#transformers.TapasTokenizer) runs end-to-end tokenization on a table and associated sentences: punctuation
splitting and wordpiece.

> Parameters

- **vocab_file** (`str`) --
  File containing the vocabulary.
- **do_lower_case** (`bool`, _optional_, defaults to `True`) --
  Whether or not to lowercase the input when tokenizing.
- **do_basic_tokenize** (`bool`, _optional_, defaults to `True`) --
  Whether or not to do basic tokenization before WordPiece.
- **never_split** (`Iterable`, _optional_) --
  Collection of tokens which will never be split during tokenization. Only has an effect when
  `do_basic_tokenize=True`
- **unk_token** (`str`, _optional_, defaults to `"[UNK]"`) --
  The unknown token. A token that is not in the vocabulary cannot be converted to an ID and is set to be this
  token instead.
- **sep_token** (`str`, _optional_, defaults to `"[SEP]"`) --
  The separator token, which is used when building a sequence from multiple sequences, e.g. two sequences for
  sequence classification or for a text and a question for question answering. It is also used as the last
  token of a sequence built with special tokens.
- **pad_token** (`str`, _optional_, defaults to `"[PAD]"`) --
  The token used for padding, for example when batching sequences of different lengths.
- **cls_token** (`str`, _optional_, defaults to `"[CLS]"`) --
  The classifier token which is used when doing sequence classification (classification of the whole sequence
  instead of per-token classification). It is the first token of the sequence when built with special tokens.
- **mask_token** (`str`, _optional_, defaults to `"[MASK]"`) --
  The token used for masking values. This is the token used when training this model with masked language
  modeling. This is the token which the model will try to predict.

Main method to tokenize and prepare for the model one or several sequence(s) related to a table.

> Parameters

- **table** (`pd.DataFrame`) --
  Table containing tabular data. Note that all cell values must be text. Use _.astype(str)_ on a Pandas
  dataframe to convert it to string.
- **queries** (`str` or `List[str]`) --
  Question or batch of questions related to a table to be encoded. Note that in case of a batch, all
  questions must refer to the **same** table.
- **answer_coordinates** (`List[Tuple]` or `List[List[Tuple]]`, _optional_) --
  Answer coordinates of each table-question pair in the batch. In case only a single table-question pair
  is provided, then the answer_coordinates must be a single list of one or more tuples. Each tuple must
  be a (row_index, column_index) pair. The first data row (not the column header row) has index 0. The
  first column has index 0. In case a batch of table-question pairs is provided, then the
  answer_coordinates must be a list of lists of tuples (each list corresponding to a single
  table-question pair).
- **answer_text** (`List[str]` or `List[List[str]]`, _optional_) --
  Answer text of each table-question pair in the batch. In case only a single table-question pair is
  provided, then the answer_text must be a single list of one or more strings. Each string must be the
  answer text of a corresponding answer coordinate. In case a batch of table-question pairs is provided,
  then the answer_coordinates must be a list of lists of strings (each list corresponding to a single
  table-question pair).

- **add_special_tokens** (`bool`, _optional_, defaults to `True`) --
  Whether or not to encode the sequences with the special tokens relative to their model.
- **padding** (`bool`, `str` or [PaddingStrategy](internal/file_utils.html#transformers.file_utils.PaddingStrategy), _optional_, defaults to `False`) --
  Activates and controls padding. Accepts the following values:

  - `True` or `'longest'`: Pad to the longest sequence in the batch (or no padding if only a
    single sequence if provided).
  - `'max_length'`: Pad to a maximum length specified with the argument `max_length` or to the
    maximum acceptable input length for the model if that argument is not provided.
  - `False` or `'do_not_pad'` (default): No padding (i.e., can output a batch with sequences of
    different lengths).
- **truncation** (`bool`, `str` or `TapasTruncationStrategy`, _optional_, defaults to `False`) --
  Activates and controls truncation. Accepts the following values:

  - `True` or `'drop_rows_to_fit'`: Truncate to a maximum length specified with the argument
    `max_length` or to the maximum acceptable input length for the model if that argument is not
    provided. This will truncate row by row, removing rows from the table.
  - `False` or `'do_not_truncate'` (default): No truncation (i.e., can output batch with
    sequence lengths greater than the model maximum admissible input size).
- **max_length** (`int`, _optional_) --
  Controls the maximum length to use by one of the truncation/padding parameters.

  If left unset or set to `None`, this will use the predefined model maximum length if a maximum
  length is required by one of the truncation/padding parameters. If the model has no specific maximum
  input length (like XLNet) truncation/padding to a maximum length will be deactivated.
- **is_split_into_words** (`bool`, _optional_, defaults to `False`) --
  Whether or not the input is already pre-tokenized (e.g., split into words). If set to `True`, the
  tokenizer assumes the input is already split into words (for instance, by splitting it on whitespace)
  which it will tokenize. This is useful for NER or token classification.
- **pad_to_multiple_of** (`int`, _optional_) --
  If set will pad the sequence to a multiple of the provided value. This is especially useful to enable
  the use of Tensor Cores on NVIDIA hardware with compute capability >= 7.5 (Volta).
- **return_tensors** (`str` or [TensorType](internal/file_utils.html#transformers.TensorType), _optional_) --
  If set, will return tensors instead of list of python integers. Acceptable values are:

  - `'tf'`: Return TensorFlow `tf.constant` objects.
  - `'pt'`: Return PyTorch `torch.Tensor` objects.
  - `'np'`: Return Numpy `np.ndarray` objects.

## TapasModel

<a id='transformers.TapasModel'></a>
> **class transformers.TapasModel**(config, add_pooling_layer = True)

The bare Tapas Model transformer outputting raw hidden-states without any specific head on top.
This model inherits from [PreTrainedModel](main_classes/model.html#transformers.PreTrainedModel). Check the superclass documentation for the generic
methods the library implements for all its models (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input embeddings,
pruning heads etc.)

This model is also a PyTorch [torch.nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module)
subclass. Use it as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to
general usage and behavior.

> Parameters

- **config** ([TapasConfig](model_doc/tapas.html#transformers.TapasConfig)) -- Model configuration class with all the parameters of the model.
  Initializing with a config file does not load the weights associated with the model, only the
  configuration. Check out the [from_pretrained()](main_classes/model.html#transformers.PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained) method to load the model
  weights.

  This class is a small change compared to [BertModel](model_doc/bert.html#transformers.BertModel), taking into account the additional token
  type ids.

  The model can behave as an encoder (with only self-attention) as well as a decoder, in which case a layer of
  cross-attention is added between the self-attention layers, following the architecture described in [Attention is
  all you need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) by Ashish Vaswani, Noam Shazeer, Niki Parmar, Jakob Uszkoreit,
  Llion Jones, Aidan N. Gomez, Lukasz Kaiser and Illia Polosukhin.



<a id='transformers.TapasModel.forward'></a>
> **forward**(self, input_ids = None, attention_mask = None, token_type_ids = None, position_ids = None, head_mask = None, inputs_embeds = None, encoder_hidden_states = None, encoder_attention_mask = None, output_attentions = None, output_hidden_states = None, return_dict = None)

The [TapasModel](model_doc/tapas.html#transformers.TapasModel) forward method, overrides the `__call__` special method.

<Tip>

Although the recipe for forward pass needs to be defined within this function, one should call the
`Module` instance afterwards instead of this since the former takes care of running the pre and post
processing steps while the latter silently ignores them.

</Tip>

> Parameters

- **input_ids** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`) --
  Indices of input sequence tokens in the vocabulary. Indices can be obtained using
  [TapasTokenizer](model_doc/tapas.html#transformers.TapasTokenizer). See [transformers.PreTrainedTokenizer.encode()](internal/tokenization_utils.html#transformers.PreTrainedTokenizerBase.encode) and
  [transformers.PreTrainedTokenizer.__call__()](internal/tokenization_utils.html#transformers.PreTrainedTokenizerBase.__call__) for details.

  [What are input IDs?](../glossary.html#input-ids)
- **attention_mask** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, _optional_) --
  Mask to avoid performing attention on padding token indices. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:

  - 1 for tokens that are **not masked**,
  - 0 for tokens that are **masked**.

  [What are attention masks?](../glossary.html#attention-mask)
- **token_type_ids** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, 7)`, _optional_) --
  Token indices that encode tabular structure. Indices can be obtained using
  [TapasTokenizer](model_doc/tapas.html#transformers.TapasTokenizer). See this class for more info.

  [What are token type IDs?](../glossary.html#token-type-ids)
- **position_ids** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, _optional_) --
  Indices of positions of each input sequence tokens in the position embeddings. If
  `reset_position_index_per_cell` of [TapasConfig](model_doc/tapas.html#transformers.TapasConfig) is set to `True`, relative
  position embeddings will be used. Selected in the range `[0, config.max_position_embeddings - 1]`.

  [What are position IDs?](../glossary.html#position-ids)
- **head_mask** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(num_heads,)` or `(num_layers, num_heads)`, _optional_) --
  Mask to nullify selected heads of the self-attention modules. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`: - 1
  indicates the head is **not masked**, - 0 indicates the head is **masked**.
- **inputs_embeds** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`, _optional_) --
  Optionally, instead of passing `input_ids` you can choose to directly pass an embedded representation.
  This is useful if you want more control over how to convert `input_ids` indices into associated
  vectors than the model's internal embedding lookup matrix.
- **output_attentions** (`bool`, _optional_) --
  Whether or not to return the attentions tensors of all attention layers. See `attentions` under returned
  tensors for more detail.
- **output_hidden_states** (`bool`, _optional_) --
  Whether or not to return the hidden states of all layers. See `hidden_states` under returned tensors for
  more detail.
- **return_dict** (`bool`, _optional_) --
  Whether or not to return a [ModelOutput](main_classes/output.html#transformers.file_utils.ModelOutput) instead of a plain tuple.


> Returns

A [BaseModelOutputWithPooling](main_classes/output.html#transformers.modeling_outputs.BaseModelOutputWithPooling) or a tuple of
`torch.FloatTensor` (if `return_dict=False` is passed or when `config.return_dict=False`) comprising

- **pooler_output** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, hidden_size)`) -- Last layer hidden-state of the first token of the sequence (classification token) after further processing
  through the layers used for the auxiliary pretraining task. E.g. for BERT-family of models, this returns
  the classification token after processing through a linear layer and a tanh activation function. The linear
  layer weights are trained from the next sentence prediction (classification) objective during pretraining.
- **hidden_states** (`tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`, _optional_, returned when `output_hidden_states=True` is passed or when `config.output_hidden_states=True`) -- Tuple of `torch.FloatTensor` (one for the output of the embeddings + one for the output of each layer)
  of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`.

## TapasForMaskedLM

<a id='transformers.TapasForMaskedLM'></a>
> **class transformers.TapasForMaskedLM**(config)

Tapas Model with a _language modeling_ head on top. 
This model inherits from [PreTrainedModel](main_classes/model.html#transformers.PreTrainedModel). Check the superclass documentation for the generic
methods the library implements for all its models (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input embeddings,
pruning heads etc.)

This model is also a PyTorch [torch.nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module)
subclass. Use it as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to
general usage and behavior.

> Parameters

- **config** ([TapasConfig](model_doc/tapas.html#transformers.TapasConfig)) -- Model configuration class with all the parameters of the model.
  Initializing with a config file does not load the weights associated with the model, only the
  configuration. Check out the [from_pretrained()](main_classes/model.html#transformers.PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained) method to load the model
  weights.

processing steps while the latter silently ignores them.

</Tip>

> Parameters

- **input_ids** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`) --
  Indices of input sequence tokens in the vocabulary. Indices can be obtained using
