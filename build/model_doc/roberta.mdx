# RoBERTa

## Overview

The RoBERTa model was proposed in [RoBERTa: A Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.11692) by Yinhan Liu, Myle Ott, Naman Goyal, Jingfei Du, Mandar Joshi, Danqi Chen, Omer
Levy, Mike Lewis, Luke Zettlemoyer, Veselin Stoyanov. It is based on Google's BERT model released in 2018.

It builds on BERT and modifies key hyperparameters, removing the next-sentence pretraining objective and training with
much larger mini-batches and learning rates.

The abstract from the paper is the following:

*Language model pretraining has led to significant performance gains but careful comparison between different
approaches is challenging. Training is computationally expensive, often done on private datasets of different sizes,
and, as we will show, hyperparameter choices have significant impact on the final results. We present a replication
study of BERT pretraining (Devlin et al., 2019) that carefully measures the impact of many key hyperparameters and
training data size. We find that BERT was significantly undertrained, and can match or exceed the performance of every
model published after it. Our best model achieves state-of-the-art results on GLUE, RACE and SQuAD. These results
highlight the importance of previously overlooked design choices, and raise questions about the source of recently
reported improvements. We release our models and code.*

Tips:

- This implementation is the same as [BertModel](model_doc/bert.html#transformers.BertModel) with a tiny embeddings tweak as well as a setup
  for Roberta pretrained models.
- RoBERTa has the same architecture as BERT, but uses a byte-level BPE as a tokenizer (same as GPT-2) and uses a
  different pretraining scheme.
- RoBERTa doesn't have `token_type_ids`, you don't need to indicate which token belongs to which segment. Just
  separate your segments with the separation token `tokenizer.sep_token` (or `&lcub/s>`)
- [CamemBERT](camembert.html) is a wrapper around RoBERTa. Refer to this page for usage examples.

This model was contributed by [julien-c](https://huggingface.co/julien-c). The original code can be found [here](https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq/tree/master/examples/roberta).


## RobertaConfig

<a id='transformers.RobertaConfig'></a>
> **class transformers.RobertaConfig**(pad_token_id = 1, bos_token_id = 0, eos_token_id = 2, **kwargs)


This is the configuration class to store the configuration of a [RobertaModel](model_doc/roberta.html#transformers.RobertaModel) or a
[TFRobertaModel](model_doc/roberta.html#transformers.TFRobertaModel). It is used to instantiate a RoBERTa model according to the specified
arguments, defining the model architecture.


Configuration objects inherit from [PretrainedConfig](main_classes/configuration.html#transformers.PretrainedConfig) and can be used to control the model
outputs. Read the documentation from [PretrainedConfig](main_classes/configuration.html#transformers.PretrainedConfig) for more information.

The [RobertaConfig](model_doc/roberta.html#transformers.RobertaConfig) class directly inherits [BertConfig](model_doc/bert.html#transformers.BertConfig). It reuses the
same defaults. Please check the parent class for more information.

> Examples:

```python
>>> from transformers import RobertaConfig, RobertaModel

>>> # Initializing a RoBERTa configuration
>>> configuration = RobertaConfig()

>>> # Initializing a model from the configuration
>>> model = RobertaModel(configuration)

>>> # Accessing the model configuration
>>> configuration = model.config
```


## RobertaTokenizer

<a id='transformers.RobertaTokenizer'></a>
> **class transformers.RobertaTokenizer**(vocab_file, merges_file, errors = replace, bos_token = &lcubs>, eos_token = &lcub/s>, sep_token = &lcub/s>, cls_token = &lcubs>, unk_token = &lcubunk>, pad_token = &lcubpad>, mask_token = &lcubmask>, add_prefix_space = False, **kwargs)


Constructs a RoBERTa tokenizer, derived from the GPT-2 tokenizer, using byte-level Byte-Pair-Encoding.

This tokenizer has been trained to treat spaces like parts of the tokens (a bit like sentencepiece) so a word will
be encoded differently whether it is at the beginning of the sentence (without space) or not:

```
>>> from transformers import RobertaTokenizer
>>> tokenizer = RobertaTokenizer.from_pretrained("roberta-base")
>>> tokenizer("Hello world")['input_ids']
[0, 31414, 232, 328, 2]
>>> tokenizer(" Hello world")['input_ids']
[0, 20920, 232, 2]
```

You can get around that behavior by passing `add_prefix_space=True` when instantiating this tokenizer or when you
call it on some text, but since the model was not pretrained this way, it might yield a decrease in performance.

<Tip>

When used with `is_split_into_words=True`, this tokenizer will add a space before each word (even the first
one).

</Tip>

This tokenizer inherits from [PreTrainedTokenizer](main_classes/tokenizer.html#transformers.PreTrainedTokenizer) which contains most of the main methods.
Users should refer to this superclass for more information regarding those methods.

> Parameters

- **vocab_file** (`str`) --
  Path to the vocabulary file.
- **merges_file** (`str`) --
  Path to the merges file.
- **errors** (`str`, _optional_, defaults to `"replace"`) --
  Paradigm to follow when decoding bytes to UTF-8. See [bytes.decode](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytes.decode) for more information.
- **bos_token** (`str`, _optional_, defaults to `"&lcubs>"`) --
  The beginning of sequence token that was used during pretraining. Can be used a sequence classifier token.

<Tip>

When building a sequence using special tokens, this is not the token that is used for the beginning of
sequence. The token used is the `cls_token`.

</Tip>

- **eos_token** (`str`, _optional_, defaults to `"&lcub/s>"`) --
  The end of sequence token.

<Tip>

When building a sequence using special tokens, this is not the token that is used for the end of
sequence. The token used is the `sep_token`.

</Tip>

- **sep_token** (`str`, _optional_, defaults to `"&lcub/s>"`) --
  The separator token, which is used when building a sequence from multiple sequences, e.g. two sequences for
  sequence classification or for a text and a question for question answering. It is also used as the last
  token of a sequence built with special tokens.
- **cls_token** (`str`, _optional_, defaults to `"&lcubs>"`) --
  The classifier token which is used when doing sequence classification (classification of the whole sequence
  instead of per-token classification). It is the first token of the sequence when built with special tokens.
- **unk_token** (`str`, _optional_, defaults to `"&lcubunk>"`) --
  The unknown token. A token that is not in the vocabulary cannot be converted to an ID and is set to be this
  token instead.
- **pad_token** (`str`, _optional_, defaults to `"&lcubpad>"`) --
  The token used for padding, for example when batching sequences of different lengths.
- **mask_token** (`str`, _optional_, defaults to `"&lcubmask>"`) --
  The token used for masking values. This is the token used when training this model with masked language
  modeling. This is the token which the model will try to predict.
- **add_prefix_space** (`bool`, _optional_, defaults to `False`) --
  Whether or not to add an initial space to the input. This allows to treat the leading word just as any
  other word. (RoBERTa tokenizer detect beginning of words by the preceding space).


<a id='transformers.RobertaTokenizer.build_inputs_with_special_tokens'></a>
> **build\_inputs\_with\_special\_tokens**(self, token_ids_0: typing.List[int], token_ids_1: typing.Optional[typing.List[int]] = None)


Build model inputs from a sequence or a pair of sequence for sequence classification tasks by concatenating and
adding special tokens. A RoBERTa sequence has the following format:

- single sequence: `&lcubs> X &lcub/s>`
- pair of sequences: `&lcubs> A &lcub/s>&lcub/s> B &lcub/s>`

> Parameters

- **token_ids_0** (`List[int]`) --
  List of IDs to which the special tokens will be added.
- **token_ids_1** (`List[int]`, _optional_) --
  Optional second list of IDs for sequence pairs.

> Returns

List of [input IDs](../glossary.html#input-ids) with the appropriate special tokens.

> Return type

`List[int]`


<a id='transformers.RobertaTokenizer.get_special_tokens_mask'></a>
> **get\_special\_tokens\_mask**(self, token_ids_0: typing.List[int], token_ids_1: typing.Optional[typing.List[int]] = None, already_has_special_tokens: bool = False)

  Whether or not the token list is already formatted with special tokens for the model.

> Returns

A list of integers in the range [0, 1]: 1 for a special token, 0 for a sequence token.

> Return type

`List[int]`


<a id='transformers.RobertaTokenizer.create_token_type_ids_from_sequences'></a>

Create a mask from the two sequences passed to be used in a sequence-pair classification task. RoBERTa does not
make use of token type ids, therefore a list of zeros is returned.

> Parameters

- **token_ids_0** (`List[int]`) --
  List of IDs.
- **token_ids_1** (`List[int]`, _optional_) --
  Optional second list of IDs for sequence pairs.

> Returns

Construct a "fast" RoBERTa tokenizer (backed by HuggingFace's _tokenizers_ library), derived from the GPT-2
tokenizer, using byte-level Byte-Pair-Encoding.

This tokenizer has been trained to treat spaces like parts of the tokens (a bit like sentencepiece) so a word will
be encoded differently whether it is at the beginning of the sentence (without space) or not:

```
>>> from transformers import RobertaTokenizerFast
>>> tokenizer = RobertaTokenizerFast.from_pretrained("roberta-base")
>>> tokenizer("Hello world")['input_ids']
[0, 31414, 232, 328, 2]
>>> tokenizer(" Hello world")['input_ids']
[0, 20920, 232, 2]
```

You can get around that behavior by passing `add_prefix_space=True` when instantiating this tokenizer or when you
call it on some text, but since the model was not pretrained this way, it might yield a decrease in performance.

<Tip>

When used with `is_split_into_words=True`, this tokenizer needs to be instantiated with
`add_prefix_space=True`.

## RobertaModel

<a id='transformers.RobertaModel'></a>
> **class transformers.RobertaModel**(config, add_pooling_layer = True)

The bare RoBERTa Model transformer outputting raw hidden-states without any specific head on top.

This model inherits from [PreTrainedModel](main_classes/model.html#transformers.PreTrainedModel). Check the superclass documentation for the generic
methods the library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input embeddings,
pruning heads etc.)

This model is also a PyTorch [torch.nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module)
subclass. Use it as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to
general usage and behavior.

> Parameters

- **config** ([RobertaConfig](model_doc/roberta.html#transformers.RobertaConfig)) -- Model configuration class with all the parameters of the
  model. Initializing with a config file does not load the weights associated with the model, only the
  configuration. Check out the [from_pretrained()](main_classes/model.html#transformers.PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained) method to load the model
  weights.


  The model can behave as an encoder (with only self-attention) as well as a decoder, in which case a layer of
  cross-attention is added between the self-attention layers, following the architecture described in _Attention is
  all you need__ by Ashish Vaswani, Noam Shazeer, Niki Parmar, Jakob Uszkoreit, Llion Jones, Aidan N. Gomez, Lukasz
  Kaiser and Illia Polosukhin.

  To behave as an decoder the model needs to be initialized with the `is_decoder` argument of the configuration
  set to `True`. To be used in a Seq2Seq model, the model needs to initialized with both `is_decoder`
  argument and `add_cross_attention` set to `True`; an `encoder_hidden_states` is then expected as an
  input to the forward pass.

  .. __Attention is all you need_: https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762



<a id='transformers.RobertaModel.forward'></a>
> **forward**(self, input_ids = None, attention_mask = None, token_type_ids = None, position_ids = None, head_mask = None, inputs_embeds = None, encoder_hidden_states = None, encoder_attention_mask = None, past_key_values = None, use_cache = None, output_attentions = None, output_hidden_states = None, return_dict = None)

The [RobertaModel](model_doc/roberta.html#transformers.RobertaModel) forward method, overrides the `__call__` special method.

<Tip>

Although the recipe for forward pass needs to be defined within this function, one should call the
`Module` instance afterwards instead of this since the former takes care of running the pre and post
processing steps while the latter silently ignores them.

</Tip>

> Parameters

- **input_ids** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`) --
  Indices of input sequence tokens in the vocabulary.

  Indices can be obtained using [RobertaTokenizer](model_doc/roberta.html#transformers.RobertaTokenizer). See
  [transformers.PreTrainedTokenizer.encode()](internal/tokenization_utils.html#transformers.PreTrainedTokenizerBase.encode) and [transformers.PreTrainedTokenizer.__call__()](internal/tokenization_utils.html#transformers.PreTrainedTokenizerBase.__call__) for
  details.

  Mask to avoid performing attention on padding token indices. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:

  - 1 for tokens that are **not masked**,
  - 0 for tokens that are **masked**.

  [What are attention masks?](../glossary.html#attention-mask)
- **token_type_ids** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, _optional_) --
  Segment token indices to indicate first and second portions of the inputs. Indices are selected in `[0, 1]`:

  - 0 corresponds to a _sentence A_ token,
  - 1 corresponds to a _sentence B_ token.

  [What are token type IDs?](../glossary.html#token-type-ids)
- **position_ids** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, _optional_) --

  [What are position IDs?](../glossary.html#position-ids)
- **head_mask** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(num_heads,)` or `(num_layers, num_heads)`, _optional_) --
  Mask to nullify selected heads of the self-attention modules. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:

  - 1 indicates the head is **not masked**,
  - 0 indicates the head is **masked**.

- **inputs_embeds** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`, _optional_) --
  Optionally, instead of passing `input_ids` you can choose to directly pass an embedded representation.
  This is useful if you want more control over how to convert `input_ids` indices into associated
  vectors than the model's internal embedding lookup matrix.
- **output_attentions** (`bool`, _optional_) --
  Whether or not to return the attentions tensors of all attention layers. See `attentions` under returned
  tensors for more detail.
- **output_hidden_states** (`bool`, _optional_) --
  Whether or not to return the hidden states of all layers. See `hidden_states` under returned tensors for
  more detail.
- **return_dict** (`bool`, _optional_) --
  Whether or not to return a [ModelOutput](main_classes/output.html#transformers.file_utils.ModelOutput) instead of a plain tuple.

- **encoder_hidden_states**  (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`, _optional_) --
  Sequence of hidden-states at the output of the last layer of the encoder. Used in the cross-attention if
  the model is configured as a decoder.
- **encoder_attention_mask** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, _optional_) --
  Mask to avoid performing attention on the padding token indices of the encoder input. This mask is used in
  the cross-attention if the model is configured as a decoder. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:

  - 1 for tokens that are **not masked**,
  - 0 for tokens that are **masked**.
- **past_key_values** (`tuple(tuple(torch.FloatTensor))` of length `config.n_layers` with each tuple having 4 tensors of shape `(batch_size, num_heads, sequence_length - 1, embed_size_per_head)`) --
  Contains precomputed key and value hidden states of the attention blocks. Can be used to speed up decoding.

  If `past_key_values` are used, the user can optionally input only the last `decoder_input_ids`
  (those that don't have their past key value states given to this model) of shape `(batch_size, 1)`
  instead of all `decoder_input_ids` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`.
- **use_cache** (`bool`, _optional_) --
  If set to `True`, `past_key_values` key value states are returned and can be used to speed up
  decoding (see `past_key_values`).

> Returns

A [BaseModelOutputWithPoolingAndCrossAttentions](main_classes/output.html#transformers.modeling_outputs.BaseModelOutputWithPoolingAndCrossAttentions) or a tuple of

- **pooler_output** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, hidden_size)`) -- Last layer hidden-state of the first token of the sequence (classification token) after further processing
  through the layers used for the auxiliary pretraining task. E.g. for BERT-family of models, this returns
  the classification token after processing through a linear layer and a tanh activation function. The linear
  layer weights are trained from the next sentence prediction (classification) objective during pretraining.
- **hidden_states** (`tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`, _optional_, returned when `output_hidden_states=True` is passed or when `config.output_hidden_states=True`) -- Tuple of `torch.FloatTensor` (one for the output of the embeddings + one for the output of each layer)
  of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`.

  Hidden-states of the model at the output of each layer plus the initial embedding outputs.
- **attentions** (`tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`, _optional_, returned when `output_attentions=True` is passed or when `config.output_attentions=True`) -- Tuple of `torch.FloatTensor` (one for each layer) of shape `(batch_size, num_heads, sequence_length, sequence_length)`.

  heads.

  weighted average in the cross-attention heads.

  `config.is_encoder_decoder=True` 2 additional tensors of shape `(batch_size, num_heads, encoder_sequence_length, embed_size_per_head)`.

  Contains pre-computed hidden-states (key and values in the self-attention blocks and optionally if
  `config.is_encoder_decoder=True` in the cross-attention blocks) that can be used (see
  `past_key_values` input) to speed up sequential decoding.

> Return type

  - 1 indicates the head is **not masked**,
  - 0 indicates the head is **masked**.

- **inputs_embeds** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`, _optional_) --
  Optionally, instead of passing `input_ids` you can choose to directly pass an embedded representation.
  This is useful if you want more control over how to convert `input_ids` indices into associated
  vectors than the model's internal embedding lookup matrix.

  Whether or not to return the attentions tensors of all attention layers. See `attentions` under returned
  tensors for more detail.
- **output_hidden_states** (`bool`, _optional_) --

  Sequence of hidden-states at the output of the last layer of the encoder. Used in the cross-attention if
  the model is configured as a decoder.
- **encoder_attention_mask** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, _optional_) --
  Mask to avoid performing attention on the padding token indices of the encoder input. This mask is used in
  the cross-attention if the model is configured as a decoder. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:

  - 0 for tokens that are **masked**.

- **labels** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, _optional_) --
  Labels for computing the left-to-right language modeling loss (next word prediction). Indices should be in
  `[-100, 0, ..., config.vocab_size]` (see `input_ids` docstring) Tokens with indices set to `-100` are
  ignored (masked), the loss is only computed for the tokens with labels in `[0, ..., config.vocab_size]`
- **past_key_values** (`tuple(tuple(torch.FloatTensor))` of length `config.n_layers` with each tuple having 4 tensors of shape `(batch_size, num_heads, sequence_length - 1, embed_size_per_head)`) --
  Contains precomputed key and value hidden states of the attention blocks. Can be used to speed up decoding.

  If `past_key_values` are used, the user can optionally input only the last `decoder_input_ids`
  (those that don't have their past key value states given to this model) of shape `(batch_size, 1)`
  instead of all `decoder_input_ids` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`.
- **use_cache** (`bool`, _optional_) --
  If set to `True`, `past_key_values` key value states are returned and can be used to speed up
  decoding (see `past_key_values`).

## TFRobertaModel

<a id='transformers.TFRobertaModel'></a>
> **class transformers.TFRobertaModel**(*args, **kwargs)

The bare RoBERTa Model transformer outputting raw hidden-states without any specific head on top.

This model inherits from [TFPreTrainedModel](main_classes/model.html#transformers.TFPreTrainedModel). Check the superclass documentation for the
generic methods the library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input
embeddings, pruning heads etc.)

This model is also a [tf.keras.Model](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/Model) subclass. Use
it as a regular TF 2.0 Keras Model and refer to the TF 2.0 documentation for all matter related to general usage
and behavior.

<Tip>

TF 2.0 models accepts two formats as inputs:

- having all inputs as keyword arguments (like PyTorch models), or
- having all inputs as a list, tuple or dict in the first positional arguments.

This second option is useful when using `tf.keras.Model.fit` method which currently requires having all
the tensors in the first argument of the model call function: `model(inputs)`.

If you choose this second option, there are three possibilities you can use to gather all the input Tensors in
the first positional argument :

- a single Tensor with `input_ids` only and nothing else: `model(inputs_ids)`
- a list of varying length with one or several input Tensors IN THE ORDER given in the docstring:
  `model([input_ids, attention_mask])` or `model([input_ids, attention_mask, token_type_ids])`
- a dictionary with one or several input Tensors associated to the input names given in the docstring:
  `model({"input_ids": input_ids, "token_type_ids": token_type_ids})`

</Tip>

> Parameters

- **config** ([RobertaConfig](model_doc/roberta.html#transformers.RobertaConfig)) -- Model configuration class with all the parameters of the
  model. Initializing with a config file does not load the weights associated with the model, only the
  configuration. Check out the [from_pretrained()](main_classes/model.html#transformers.PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained) method to load the model

The [TFRobertaModel](model_doc/roberta.html#transformers.TFRobertaModel) forward method, overrides the `__call__` special method.

## TFRobertaForSequenceClassification

<a id='transformers.TFRobertaForSequenceClassification'></a>
> **class transformers.TFRobertaForSequenceClassification**(*args, **kwargs)


RoBERTa Model transformer with a sequence classification/regression head on top (a linear layer on top of the
pooled output) e.g. for GLUE tasks.


This model inherits from [TFPreTrainedModel](main_classes/model.html#transformers.TFPreTrainedModel). Check the superclass documentation for the
generic methods the library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input
embeddings, pruning heads etc.)

This model is also a [tf.keras.Model](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/Model) subclass. Use
it as a regular TF 2.0 Keras Model and refer to the TF 2.0 documentation for all matter related to general usage
and behavior.

<Tip>

TF 2.0 models accepts two formats as inputs:

- having all inputs as keyword arguments (like PyTorch models), or
- having all inputs as a list, tuple or dict in the first positional arguments.

This second option is useful when using `tf.keras.Model.fit` method which currently requires having all
the tensors in the first argument of the model call function: `model(inputs)`.

If you choose this second option, there are three possibilities you can use to gather all the input Tensors in
the first positional argument :

- a single Tensor with `input_ids` only and nothing else: `model(inputs_ids)`
- a list of varying length with one or several input Tensors IN THE ORDER given in the docstring:
  `model([input_ids, attention_mask])` or `model([input_ids, attention_mask, token_type_ids])`
- a dictionary with one or several input Tensors associated to the input names given in the docstring:
  `model({"input_ids": input_ids, "token_type_ids": token_type_ids})`

</Tip>

> Parameters

- **config** ([RobertaConfig](model_doc/roberta.html#transformers.RobertaConfig)) -- Model configuration class with all the parameters of the
  model. Initializing with a config file does not load the weights associated with the model, only the
  configuration. Check out the [from_pretrained()](main_classes/model.html#transformers.PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained) method to load the model
  weights.


<a id='transformers.TFRobertaForSequenceClassification.call'></a>
> **call**(self, input_ids = None, attention_mask = None, token_type_ids = None, position_ids = None, head_mask = None, inputs_embeds = None, output_attentions = None, output_hidden_states = None, return_dict = None, labels = None, training = False, **kwargs)

The [TFRobertaForSequenceClassification](model_doc/roberta.html#transformers.TFRobertaForSequenceClassification) forward method, overrides the `__call__` special method.

<Tip>

Although the recipe for forward pass needs to be defined within this function, one should call the
`Module` instance afterwards instead of this since the former takes care of running the pre and post
processing steps while the latter silently ignores them.

</Tip>

> Parameters

- **input_ids** (`Numpy array` or `tf.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`) --
  Indices of input sequence tokens in the vocabulary.

  Indices can be obtained using [RobertaTokenizer](model_doc/roberta.html#transformers.RobertaTokenizer). See
  [transformers.PreTrainedTokenizer.__call__()](internal/tokenization_utils.html#transformers.PreTrainedTokenizerBase.__call__) and [transformers.PreTrainedTokenizer.encode()](internal/tokenization_utils.html#transformers.PreTrainedTokenizerBase.encode) for
  details.

  Mask to avoid performing attention on padding token indices. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:

  - 1 for tokens that are **not masked**,
  - 0 for tokens that are **masked**.

  [What are attention masks?](../glossary.html#attention-mask)
- **token_type_ids** (`Numpy array` or `tf.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, _optional_) --
  Segment token indices to indicate first and second portions of the inputs. Indices are selected in `[0, 1]`:

  - 0 corresponds to a _sentence A_ token,
  - 1 corresponds to a _sentence B_ token.

  [What are token type IDs?](../glossary.html#token-type-ids)

  Mask to nullify selected heads of the self-attention modules. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:

  - 1 indicates the head is **not masked**,
  - 0 indicates the head is **masked**.

- **inputs_embeds** (`tf.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`, _optional_) --
  Optionally, instead of passing `input_ids` you can choose to directly pass an embedded representation.
  This is useful if you want more control over how to convert `input_ids` indices into associated
  vectors than the model's internal embedding lookup matrix.
- **output_attentions** (`bool`, _optional_) --
  Whether or not to return the attentions tensors of all attention layers. See `attentions` under returned
  tensors for more detail. This argument can be used only in eager mode, in graph mode the value in the

  Whether or not to return the hidden states of all layers. See `hidden_states` under returned tensors for
  more detail. This argument can be used only in eager mode, in graph mode the value in the config will be
  used instead.
- **return_dict** (`bool`, _optional_) --
  Whether or not to return a [ModelOutput](main_classes/output.html#transformers.file_utils.ModelOutput) instead of a plain tuple. This
  argument can be used in eager mode, in graph mode the value will always be set to True.
- **training** (`bool`, _optional_, defaults to `False`) --
  Whether or not to use the model in training mode (some modules like dropout modules have different
  behaviors between training and evaluation).

- **labels** (`tf.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size,)`, _optional_) --
  Labels for computing the sequence classification/regression loss. Indices should be in `[0, ..., config.num_labels - 1]`. If `config.num_labels == 1` a regression loss is computed (Mean-Square loss),
  If `config.num_labels > 1` a classification loss is computed (Cross-Entropy).

`tf.Tensor` (if `return_dict=False` is passed or when `config.return_dict=False`) comprising various
elements depending on the configuration ([RobertaConfig](model_doc/roberta.html#transformers.RobertaConfig)) and inputs.

- **loss** (`tf.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size, )`, _optional_, returned when `labels` is provided) -- Classification (or regression if config.num_labels==1) loss.

the first positional argument :

- a single Tensor with `input_ids` only and nothing else: `model(inputs_ids)`
- a list of varying length with one or several input Tensors IN THE ORDER given in the docstring:
  `model([input_ids, attention_mask])` or `model([input_ids, attention_mask, token_type_ids])`
- a dictionary with one or several input Tensors associated to the input names given in the docstring:
  `model({"input_ids": input_ids, "token_type_ids": token_type_ids})`

</Tip>

> Parameters

- **config** ([RobertaConfig](model_doc/roberta.html#transformers.RobertaConfig)) -- Model configuration class with all the parameters of the
  model. Initializing with a config file does not load the weights associated with the model, only the
  configuration. Check out the [from_pretrained()](main_classes/model.html#transformers.PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained) method to load the model
  weights.

The [TFRobertaForQuestionAnswering](model_doc/roberta.html#transformers.TFRobertaForQuestionAnswering) forward method, overrides the `__call__` special method.

<Tip>

Although the recipe for forward pass needs to be defined within this function, one should call the
`Module` instance afterwards instead of this since the former takes care of running the pre and post
processing steps while the latter silently ignores them.

</Tip>

> Parameters

- **input_ids** (`Numpy array` or `tf.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`) --
  Indices of input sequence tokens in the vocabulary.

  Indices can be obtained using [RobertaTokenizer](model_doc/roberta.html#transformers.RobertaTokenizer). See
  [transformers.PreTrainedTokenizer.__call__()](internal/tokenization_utils.html#transformers.PreTrainedTokenizerBase.__call__) and [transformers.PreTrainedTokenizer.encode()](internal/tokenization_utils.html#transformers.PreTrainedTokenizerBase.encode) for

  Mask to nullify selected heads of the self-attention modules. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:

  - 1 indicates the head is **not masked**,
  - 0 indicates the head is **masked**.

- **inputs_embeds** (`tf.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`, _optional_) --
  Optionally, instead of passing `input_ids` you can choose to directly pass an embedded representation.
  This is useful if you want more control over how to convert `input_ids` indices into associated
  vectors than the model's internal embedding lookup matrix.

  Whether or not to return a [ModelOutput](main_classes/output.html#transformers.file_utils.ModelOutput) instead of a plain tuple. This
  argument can be used in eager mode, in graph mode the value will always be set to True.
- **training** (`bool`, _optional_, defaults to `False`) --
  Whether or not to use the model in training mode (some modules like dropout modules have different
  behaviors between training and evaluation).

  Labels for position (index) of the end of the labelled span for computing the token classification loss.
  Positions are clamped to the length of the sequence (`sequence_length`). Position outside of the
  sequence are not taken into account for computing the loss.

The `FlaxRobertaPreTrainedModel` forward method, overrides the `__call__` special method.

<Tip>

Although the recipe for forward pass needs to be defined within this function, one should call the
`Module` instance afterwards instead of this since the former takes care of running the pre and post
processing steps while the latter silently ignores them.

</Tip>

Roberta Model with a token classification head on top (a linear layer on top of the hidden-states output) e.g. for
Named-Entity-Recognition (NER) tasks.


This model inherits from [FlaxPreTrainedModel](main_classes/model.html#transformers.FlaxPreTrainedModel). Check the superclass documentation for the
generic methods the library implements for all its model (such as downloading, saving and converting weights from
PyTorch models)

This model is also a Flax Linen [flax.linen.Module](https://flax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/flax.linen.html#module) subclass. Use it as a regular Flax linen Module
and refer to the Flax documentation for all matter related to general usage and behavior.

Finally, this model supports inherent JAX features such as:

- [Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jax.html#just-in-time-compilation-jit)
- [Automatic Differentiation](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jax.html#automatic-differentiation)
- [Vectorization](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jax.html#vectorization-vmap)
- [Parallelization](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jax.html#parallelization-pmap)

> Parameters

- **config** ([RobertaConfig](model_doc/roberta.html#transformers.RobertaConfig)) -- Model configuration class with all the parameters of the
  model. Initializing with a config file does not load the weights associated with the model, only the
  configuration. Check out the [from_pretrained()](main_classes/model.html#transformers.FlaxPreTrainedModel.from_pretrained) method to load the
  model weights.
