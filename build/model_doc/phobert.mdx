# PhoBERT

## Overview

The PhoBERT model was proposed in [PhoBERT: Pre-trained language models for Vietnamese](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.findings-emnlp.92.pdf) by Dat Quoc Nguyen, Anh Tuan Nguyen.

The abstract from the paper is the following:

*We present PhoBERT with two versions, PhoBERT-base and PhoBERT-large, the first public large-scale monolingual
language models pre-trained for Vietnamese. Experimental results show that PhoBERT consistently outperforms the recent
best pre-trained multilingual model XLM-R (Conneau et al., 2020) and improves the state-of-the-art in multiple
Vietnamese-specific NLP tasks including Part-of-speech tagging, Dependency parsing, Named-entity recognition and
Natural language inference.*

Example of use:

```
>>> import torch
>>> from transformers import AutoModel, AutoTokenizer

>>> phobert = AutoModel.from_pretrained("vinai/phobert-base")
>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("vinai/phobert-base")

>>> # INPUT TEXT MUST BE ALREADY WORD-SEGMENTED!
>>> line = "Tôi là sinh_viên trường đại_học Công_nghệ ."

>>> input_ids = torch.tensor([tokenizer.encode(line)])

>>> with torch.no_grad():
...     features = phobert(input_ids)  # Models outputs are now tuples

>>> # With TensorFlow 2.0+:
>>> # from transformers import TFAutoModel
>>> # phobert = TFAutoModel.from_pretrained("vinai/phobert-base")
```

This model was contributed by [dqnguyen](https://huggingface.co/dqnguyen). The original code can be found [here](https://github.com/VinAIResearch/PhoBERT).

## PhobertTokenizer

<a id='transformers.PhobertTokenizer'></a>
> **class transformers.PhobertTokenizer**(vocab_file, merges_file, bos_token = <s>, eos_token = </s>, sep_token = </s>, cls_token = <s>, unk_token = <unk>, pad_token = <pad>, mask_token = <mask>, **kwargs)


Construct a PhoBERT tokenizer. Based on Byte-Pair-Encoding.

This tokenizer inherits from [PreTrainedTokenizer](docs/transformers/:version/:language/main_classes/tokenizer.html#transformers.PreTrainedTokenizer) which contains most of the main methods.
Users should refer to this superclass for more information regarding those methods.

> Parameters

- **vocab_file** (`str`) --
  Path to the vocabulary file.
- **merges_file** (`str`) --
  Path to the merges file.
- **bos_token** (`st`, _optional_, defaults to `"<s>"`) --
  The beginning of sequence token that was used during pretraining. Can be used a sequence classifier token.

<Tip>

When building a sequence using special tokens, this is not the token that is used for the beginning of
sequence. The token used is the `cls_token`.

</Tip>

- **eos_token** (`str`, _optional_, defaults to `"</s>"`) --
  The end of sequence token.

<Tip>

When building a sequence using special tokens, this is not the token that is used for the end of
sequence. The token used is the `sep_token`.

</Tip>

- **sep_token** (`str`, _optional_, defaults to `"&amp;lt;/s>"`) --
  The separator token, which is used when building a sequence from multiple sequences, e.g. two sequences for
  sequence classification or for a text and a question for question answering. It is also used as the last
  token of a sequence built with special tokens.
- **cls_token** (`str`, _optional_, defaults to `"&amp;lt;s>"`) --
  The classifier token which is used when doing sequence classification (classification of the whole sequence
  instead of per-token classification). It is the first token of the sequence when built with special tokens.
- **unk_token** (`str`, _optional_, defaults to `"&amp;lt;unk>"`) --
  The unknown token. A token that is not in the vocabulary cannot be converted to an ID and is set to be this
  token instead.
- **pad_token** (`str`, _optional_, defaults to `"&amp;lt;pad>"`) --
  The token used for padding, for example when batching sequences of different lengths.
- **mask_token** (`str`, _optional_, defaults to `"&amp;lt;mask>"`) --
  The token used for masking values. This is the token used when training this model with masked language
  modeling. This is the token which the model will try to predict.


<a id='transformers.PhobertTokenizer.add_from_file'></a>
> **add\_from\_file**(self, f)


Loads a pre-existing dictionary from a text file and adds its symbols to this instance.


<a id='transformers.PhobertTokenizer.build_inputs_with_special_tokens'></a>
> **build\_inputs\_with\_special\_tokens**(self, token_ids_0: typing.List[int], token_ids_1: typing.Optional[typing.List[int]] = None)


Build model inputs from a sequence or a pair of sequence for sequence classification tasks by concatenating and
adding special tokens. A PhoBERT sequence has the following format:

- single sequence: `<s> X </s>`
- pair of sequences: `<s> A </s>&amp;lt;/s> B &amp;lt;/s>`

> Parameters

- **token_ids_0** (`List[int]`) --
  List of IDs to which the special tokens will be added.
- **token_ids_1** (`List[int]`, _optional_) --
  Optional second list of IDs for sequence pairs.

> Returns

List of [input IDs](../glossary.html#input-ids) with the appropriate special tokens.

> Return type

`List[int]`


<a id='transformers.PhobertTokenizer.convert_tokens_to_string'></a>
> **convert\_tokens\_to\_string**(self, tokens)

Converts a sequence of tokens (string) in a single string.

<a id='transformers.PhobertTokenizer.create_token_type_ids_from_sequences'></a>
> **create\_token\_type\_ids\_from\_sequences**(self, token_ids_0: typing.List[int], token_ids_1: typing.Optional[typing.List[int]] = None)


Create a mask from the two sequences passed to be used in a sequence-pair classification task. PhoBERT does not
make use of token type ids, therefore a list of zeros is returned.

> Parameters

- **token_ids_0** (`List[int]`) --
  List of IDs.
- **token_ids_1** (`List[int]`, _optional_) --
  Optional second list of IDs for sequence pairs.

> Returns

List of zeros.

> Return type

`List[int]`


<a id='transformers.PhobertTokenizer.get_special_tokens_mask'></a>
> **get\_special\_tokens\_mask**(self, token_ids_0: typing.List[int], token_ids_1: typing.Optional[typing.List[int]] = None, already_has_special_tokens: bool = False)


Retrieve sequence ids from a token list that has no special tokens added. This method is called when adding
special tokens using the tokenizer `prepare_for_model` method.

> Parameters

- **token_ids_0** (`List[int]`) --
  List of IDs.
- **token_ids_1** (`List[int]`, _optional_) --
  Optional second list of IDs for sequence pairs.
- **already_has_special_tokens** (`bool`, _optional_, defaults to `False`) --
  Whether or not the token list is already formatted with special tokens for the model.

> Returns

A list of integers in the range [0, 1]: 1 for a special token, 0 for a sequence token.

> Return type

`List[int]`
