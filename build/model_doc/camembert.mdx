# CamemBERT

## Overview

The CamemBERT model was proposed in [CamemBERT: a Tasty French Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.03894) by
Louis Martin, Benjamin Muller, Pedro Javier Ortiz Suárez, Yoann Dupont, Laurent Romary, Éric Villemonte de la
Clergerie, Djamé Seddah, and Benoît Sagot. It is based on Facebook's RoBERTa model released in 2019. It is a model
trained on 138GB of French text.

The abstract from the paper is the following:

*Pretrained language models are now ubiquitous in Natural Language Processing. Despite their success, most available
models have either been trained on English data or on the concatenation of data in multiple languages. This makes
practical use of such models --in all languages except English-- very limited. Aiming to address this issue for French,
we release CamemBERT, a French version of the Bi-directional Encoders for Transformers (BERT). We measure the
performance of CamemBERT compared to multilingual models in multiple downstream tasks, namely part-of-speech tagging,
dependency parsing, named-entity recognition, and natural language inference. CamemBERT improves the state of the art
for most of the tasks considered. We release the pretrained model for CamemBERT hoping to foster research and
downstream applications for French NLP.*

Tips:

- This implementation is the same as RoBERTa. Refer to the [documentation of RoBERTa](roberta.html) for usage examples
  as well as the information relative to the inputs and outputs.

This model was contributed by [camembert](https://huggingface.co/camembert). The original code can be found [here](https://camembert-model.fr/).

> **class transformers.CamembertConfig**(pad_token_id = 1, bos_token_id = 0, eos_token_id = 2, **kwargs)


This class overrides [RobertaConfig](model_doc/roberta.html#transformers.RobertaConfig). Please check the superclass for the appropriate
documentation alongside usage examples.


## CamembertTokenizer

<a id='transformers.CamembertTokenizer'></a>
> **class transformers.CamembertTokenizer**(vocab_file, bos_token = <s>, eos_token = </s>, sep_token = </s>, cls_token = <s>, unk_token = <unk>, pad_token = <pad>, mask_token = <mask>, additional_special_tokens = ['<s>NOTUSED', '</s>NOTUSED'], sp_model_kwargs: typing.Union[typing.Dict[str, typing.Any], NoneType] = None, **kwargs)


Adapted from [RobertaTokenizer](model_doc/roberta.html#transformers.RobertaTokenizer) and [XLNetTokenizer](model_doc/xlnet.html#transformers.XLNetTokenizer). Construct a
CamemBERT tokenizer. Based on [SentencePiece](https://github.com/google/sentencepiece).

This tokenizer inherits from [PreTrainedTokenizer](main_classes/tokenizer.html#transformers.PreTrainedTokenizer) which contains most of the main methods.
Users should refer to this superclass for more information regarding those methods.

> Parameters

- **vocab_file** (`str`) --
  [SentencePiece](https://github.com/google/sentencepiece) file (generally has a _.spm_ extension) that
  contains the vocabulary necessary to instantiate a tokenizer.
- **bos_token** (`str`, _optional_, defaults to `"<s>"`) --
  The beginning of sequence token that was used during pretraining. Can be used a sequence classifier token.

<Tip>

When building a sequence using special tokens, this is not the token that is used for the beginning of
sequence. The token used is the `cls_token`.

</Tip>

- **eos_token** (`str`, _optional_, defaults to `"</s>"`) --
  The end of sequence token.

<Tip>

When building a sequence using special tokens, this is not the token that is used for the end of
sequence. The token used is the `sep_token`.

</Tip>

- **sep_token** (`str`, _optional_, defaults to `"</s>"`) --
  The separator token, which is used when building a sequence from multiple sequences, e.g. two sequences for
  sequence classification or for a text and a question for question answering. It is also used as the last
  token of a sequence built with special tokens.
- **cls_token** (`str`, _optional_, defaults to `"<s>"`) --
  The classifier token which is used when doing sequence classification (classification of the whole sequence
  instead of per-token classification). It is the first token of the sequence when built with special tokens.
- **unk_token** (`str`, _optional_, defaults to `"<unk>"`) --
  The unknown token. A token that is not in the vocabulary cannot be converted to an ID and is set to be this
  token instead.
- **pad_token** (`str`, _optional_, defaults to `"<pad>"`) --
  The token used for padding, for example when batching sequences of different lengths.
- **mask_token** (`str`, _optional_, defaults to `"<mask>"`) --
  The token used for masking values. This is the token used when training this model with masked language
  modeling. This is the token which the model will try to predict.
- **additional_special_tokens** (`List[str]`, _optional_, defaults to `["<s>NOTUSED", "</s>NOTUSED"]`) --
  Additional special tokens used by the tokenizer.
- **sp_model_kwargs** (`dict`, _optional_) --
  Will be passed to the `SentencePieceProcessor.__init__()` method. The [Python wrapper for SentencePiece](https://github.com/google/sentencepiece/tree/master/python) can be used, among other things, to set:

  - `enable_sampling`: Enable subword regularization.
  - `nbest_size`: Sampling parameters for unigram. Invalid for BPE-Dropout.

    - `nbest_size = {0,1}`: No sampling is performed.
    - `nbest_size > 1`: samples from the nbest_size results.
    - `nbest_size < 0`: assuming that nbest_size is infinite and samples from the all hypothesis (lattice)
      using forward-filtering-and-backward-sampling algorithm.

  - `alpha`: Smoothing parameter for unigram sampling, and dropout probability of merge operations for
    BPE-dropout.

  Attributes:
sp_model (`SentencePieceProcessor`):
The _SentencePiece_ processor that is used for every conversion (string, tokens and IDs).

embeddings, pruning heads etc.)

This model is also a [tf.keras.Model](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/Model) subclass. Use
it as a regular TF 2.0 Keras Model and refer to the TF 2.0 documentation for all matter related to general usage
and behavior.

<Tip>

TF 2.0 models accepts two formats as inputs:

- having all inputs as keyword arguments (like PyTorch models), or
- having all inputs as a list, tuple or dict in the first positional arguments.

This second option is useful when using `tf.keras.Model.fit` method which currently requires having all
the tensors in the first argument of the model call function: `model(inputs)`.

If you choose this second option, there are three possibilities you can use to gather all the input Tensors in
the first positional argument :

- a single Tensor with `input_ids` only and nothing else: `model(inputs_ids)`
- a list of varying length with one or several input Tensors IN THE ORDER given in the docstring:
  `model([input_ids, attention_mask])` or `model([input_ids, attention_mask, token_type_ids])`
- a dictionary with one or several input Tensors associated to the input names given in the docstring:
  `model({"input_ids": input_ids, "token_type_ids": token_type_ids})`

</Tip>

> Parameters

- **config** ([CamembertConfig](model_doc/camembert.html#transformers.CamembertConfig)) -- Model configuration class with all the parameters of the
  model. Initializing with a config file does not load the weights associated with the model, only the
  configuration. Check out the [from_pretrained()](main_classes/model.html#transformers.PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained) method to load the model
  weights.

  This class overrides [TFRobertaModel](model_doc/roberta.html#transformers.TFRobertaModel). Please check the superclass for the appropriate
  documentation alongside usage examples.
