# BigBird

## Overview

The BigBird model was proposed in [Big Bird: Transformers for Longer Sequences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.14062) by
Zaheer, Manzil and Guruganesh, Guru and Dubey, Kumar Avinava and Ainslie, Joshua and Alberti, Chris and Ontanon,
Santiago and Pham, Philip and Ravula, Anirudh and Wang, Qifan and Yang, Li and others. BigBird, is a sparse-attention
based transformer which extends Transformer based models, such as BERT to much longer sequences. In addition to sparse
attention, BigBird also applies global attention as well as random attention to the input sequence. Theoretically, it
has been shown that applying sparse, global, and random attention approximates full attention, while being
computationally much more efficient for longer sequences. As a consequence of the capability to handle longer context,
BigBird has shown improved performance on various long document NLP tasks, such as question answering and
summarization, compared to BERT or RoBERTa.

The abstract from the paper is the following:

*Transformers-based models, such as BERT, have been one of the most successful deep learning models for NLP.
Unfortunately, one of their core limitations is the quadratic dependency (mainly in terms of memory) on the sequence
length due to their full attention mechanism. To remedy this, we propose, BigBird, a sparse attention mechanism that
reduces this quadratic dependency to linear. We show that BigBird is a universal approximator of sequence functions and
is Turing complete, thereby preserving these properties of the quadratic, full attention model. Along the way, our
theoretical analysis reveals some of the benefits of having O(1) global tokens (such as CLS), that attend to the entire
sequence as part of the sparse attention mechanism. The proposed sparse attention can handle sequences of length up to
8x of what was previously possible using similar hardware. As a consequence of the capability to handle longer context,
BigBird drastically improves performance on various NLP tasks such as question answering and summarization. We also
propose novel applications to genomics data.*

Tips:

- For an in-detail explanation on how BigBird's attention works, see [this blog post](https://huggingface.co/blog/big-bird).
- BigBird comes with 2 implementations: **original_full** & **block_sparse**. For the sequence length < 1024, using
  **original_full** is advised as there is no benefit in using **block_sparse** attention.
- The code currently uses window size of 3 blocks and 2 global blocks.
- Sequence length must be divisible by block size.
- Current implementation supports only **ITC**.
- Current implementation doesn't support **num_random_blocks = 0**

This model was contributed by [vasudevgupta](https://huggingface.co/vasudevgupta). The original code can be found
[here](https://github.com/google-research/bigbird).

This is the configuration class to store the configuration of a [BigBirdModel](model_doc/bigbird.html#transformers.BigBirdModel). It is used to
instantiate an BigBird model according to the specified arguments, defining the model architecture. Instantiating a
configuration with the defaults will yield a similar configuration to that of the BigBird
[google/bigbird-roberta-base](https://huggingface.co/google/bigbird-roberta-base) architecture.

Configuration objects inherit from [PretrainedConfig](main_classes/configuration.html#transformers.PretrainedConfig) and can be used to control the model
outputs. Read the documentation from [PretrainedConfig](main_classes/configuration.html#transformers.PretrainedConfig) for more information.

Output type of [BigBirdForPreTraining](model_doc/bigbird.html#transformers.BigBirdForPreTraining).

  Attentions weights after the attention softmax, used to compute the weighted average in the self-attention
  heads.


## BigBirdModel

<a id='transformers.BigBirdModel'></a>
> **class transformers.BigBirdModel**(config, add_pooling_layer = True)

The bare BigBird Model transformer outputting raw hidden-states without any specific head on top.
This model is a PyTorch [torch.nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module) sub-class. Use
it as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to general usage and
behavior.

> Parameters

- **config** ([BigBirdConfig](model_doc/bigbird.html#transformers.BigBirdConfig)) -- Model configuration class with all the parameters of the model.
  Initializing with a config file does not load the weights associated with the model, only the
  configuration. Check out the [from_pretrained()](main_classes/model.html#transformers.PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained) method to load the model
  weights.


  The model can behave as an encoder (with only self-attention) as well as a decoder, in which case a layer of
  cross-attention is added between the self-attention layers, following the architecture described in [Attention is
  all you need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) by Ashish Vaswani, Noam Shazeer, Niki Parmar, Jakob Uszkoreit,
  Llion Jones, Aidan N. Gomez, Lukasz Kaiser and Illia Polosukhin.

  To behave as an decoder the model needs to be initialized with the `is_decoder` argument of the configuration
  set to `True`. To be used in a Seq2Seq model, the model needs to initialized with both `is_decoder`
  argument and `add_cross_attention` set to `True`; an `encoder_hidden_states` is then expected as an
  input to the forward pass.


<a id='transformers.BigBirdModel.forward'></a>
> **forward**(self, input_ids = None, attention_mask = None, token_type_ids = None, position_ids = None, head_mask = None, inputs_embeds = None, encoder_hidden_states = None, encoder_attention_mask = None, past_key_values = None, use_cache = None, output_attentions = None, output_hidden_states = None, return_dict = None)

The [BigBirdModel](model_doc/bigbird.html#transformers.BigBirdModel) forward method, overrides the `__call__` special method.

<Tip>

Although the recipe for forward pass needs to be defined within this function, one should call the
`Module` instance afterwards instead of this since the former takes care of running the pre and post
processing steps while the latter silently ignores them.

</Tip>

## BigBirdForSequenceClassification

<a id='transformers.BigBirdForSequenceClassification'></a>
> **class transformers.BigBirdForSequenceClassification**(config)


BigBird Model transformer with a sequence classification/regression head on top (a linear layer on top of the
pooled output) e.g. for GLUE tasks.

This model is a PyTorch [torch.nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module) sub-class. Use
it as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to general usage and
behavior.

> Parameters

- **config** ([BigBirdConfig](model_doc/bigbird.html#transformers.BigBirdConfig)) -- Model configuration class with all the parameters of the model.
  Initializing with a config file does not load the weights associated with the model, only the
  configuration. Check out the [from_pretrained()](main_classes/model.html#transformers.PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained) method to load the model
  weights.

The [BigBirdForSequenceClassification](model_doc/bigbird.html#transformers.BigBirdForSequenceClassification) forward method, overrides the `__call__` special method.

<Tip>

Although the recipe for forward pass needs to be defined within this function, one should call the
`Module` instance afterwards instead of this since the former takes care of running the pre and post
processing steps while the latter silently ignores them.

</Tip>

> Parameters

- **input_ids** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`) --
  Indices of input sequence tokens in the vocabulary.

  Indices can be obtained using [transformers.BigBirdTokenizer](model_doc/bigbird.html#transformers.BigBirdTokenizer). See
  [transformers.PreTrainedTokenizer.encode()](internal/tokenization_utils.html#transformers.PreTrainedTokenizerBase.encode) and [transformers.PreTrainedTokenizer.__call__()](internal/tokenization_utils.html#transformers.PreTrainedTokenizerBase.__call__) for

## FlaxBigBirdModel

<a id='transformers.FlaxBigBirdModel'></a>
> **class transformers.FlaxBigBirdModel**(config: BigBirdConfig, input_shape: typing.Optional[tuple] = None, seed: int = 0, dtype: dtype = <class 'jax._src.numpy.lax_numpy.float32'>, **kwargs)

The bare BigBird Model transformer outputting raw hidden-states without any specific head on top.

This model inherits from [FlaxPreTrainedModel](main_classes/model.html#transformers.FlaxPreTrainedModel). Check the superclass documentation for the
generic methods the library implements for all its model (such as downloading, saving and converting weights from
PyTorch models)

This model is also a Flax Linen [flax.linen.Module](https://flax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/flax.linen.html#module) subclass. Use it as a regular Flax linen Module
and refer to the Flax documentation for all matter related to general usage and behavior.

Finally, this model supports inherent JAX features such as:

- [Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jax.html#just-in-time-compilation-jit)
- [Automatic Differentiation](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jax.html#automatic-differentiation)
- [Vectorization](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jax.html#vectorization-vmap)
- [Parallelization](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jax.html#parallelization-pmap)

> Parameters

- **config** ([BigBirdConfig](model_doc/bigbird.html#transformers.BigBirdConfig)) -- Model configuration class with all the parameters of the model.
  Initializing with a config file does not load the weights associated with the model, only the
  configuration. Check out the [from_pretrained()](main_classes/model.html#transformers.FlaxPreTrainedModel.from_pretrained) method to load the
  model weights.

## FlaxBigBirdForTokenClassification

<a id='transformers.FlaxBigBirdForTokenClassification'></a>
> **class transformers.FlaxBigBirdForTokenClassification**(config: BigBirdConfig, input_shape: typing.Optional[tuple] = None, seed: int = 0, dtype: dtype = <class 'jax._src.numpy.lax_numpy.float32'>, **kwargs)


BigBird Model with a token classification head on top (a linear layer on top of the hidden-states output) e.g. for
Named-Entity-Recognition (NER) tasks.


This model inherits from [FlaxPreTrainedModel](main_classes/model.html#transformers.FlaxPreTrainedModel). Check the superclass documentation for the
generic methods the library implements for all its model (such as downloading, saving and converting weights from
PyTorch models)

This model is also a Flax Linen [flax.linen.Module](https://flax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/flax.linen.html#module) subclass. Use it as a regular Flax linen Module
and refer to the Flax documentation for all matter related to general usage and behavior.

Finally, this model supports inherent JAX features such as:

- [Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jax.html#just-in-time-compilation-jit)
- [Automatic Differentiation](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jax.html#automatic-differentiation)
- [Vectorization](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jax.html#vectorization-vmap)
- [Parallelization](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jax.html#parallelization-pmap)

> Parameters

- **config** ([BigBirdConfig](model_doc/bigbird.html#transformers.BigBirdConfig)) -- Model configuration class with all the parameters of the model.
  Initializing with a config file does not load the weights associated with the model, only the
  configuration. Check out the [from_pretrained()](main_classes/model.html#transformers.FlaxPreTrainedModel.from_pretrained) method to load the
  model weights.


<a id='transformers.FlaxBigBirdPreTrainedModel.__call__'></a>
> **\_\_call\_\_**(self, input_ids, attention_mask = None, token_type_ids = None, position_ids = None, params: dict = None, dropout_rng: PRNGKey = None, train: bool = False, output_attentions: typing.Optional[bool] = None, output_hidden_states: typing.Optional[bool] = None, return_dict: typing.Optional[bool] = None)

The `FlaxBigBirdPreTrainedModel` forward method, overrides the `__call__` special method.

<Tip>

Although the recipe for forward pass needs to be defined within this function, one should call the
`Module` instance afterwards instead of this since the former takes care of running the pre and post
processing steps while the latter silently ignores them.

</Tip>

> Parameters
