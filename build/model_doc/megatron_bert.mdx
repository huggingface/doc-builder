# [MegatronBERT](#megatronbert)

## [Overview](#overview)

The MegatronBERT model was proposed in [Megatron-LM: Training Multi-Billion Parameter Language Models Using Model
Parallelism](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.08053) by Mohammad Shoeybi, Mostofa Patwary, Raul Puri, Patrick LeGresley,
Jared Casper and Bryan Catanzaro.

The abstract from the paper is the following:

*Recent work in language modeling demonstrates that training large transformer models advances the state of the art in
Natural Language Processing applications. However, very large models can be quite difficult to train due to memory
constraints. In this work, we present our techniques for training very large transformer models and implement a simple,
efficient intra-layer model parallel approach that enables training transformer models with billions of parameters. Our
approach does not require a new compiler or library changes, is orthogonal and complimentary to pipeline model
parallelism, and can be fully implemented with the insertion of a few communication operations in native PyTorch. We
illustrate this approach by converging transformer based models up to 8.3 billion parameters using 512 GPUs. We sustain
15.1 PetaFLOPs across the entire application with 76% scaling efficiency when compared to a strong single GPU baseline
that sustains 39 TeraFLOPs, which is 30% of peak FLOPs. To demonstrate that large language models can further advance
the state of the art (SOTA), we train an 8.3 billion parameter transformer language model similar to GPT-2 and a 3.9
billion parameter model similar to BERT. We show that careful attention to the placement of layer normalization in
BERT-like models is critical to achieving increased performance as the model size grows. Using the GPT-2 model we
achieve SOTA results on the WikiText103 (10.8 compared to SOTA perplexity of 15.8) and LAMBADA (66.5% compared to SOTA
accuracy of 63.2%) datasets. Our BERT model achieves SOTA results on the RACE dataset (90.9% compared to SOTA accuracy
of 89.4%).*

Tips:

We have provided pretrained [BERT-345M](https://ngc.nvidia.com/catalog/models/nvidia:megatron_bert_345m) checkpoints
for use to evaluate or finetuning downstream tasks.

To access these checkpoints, first [sign up](https://ngc.nvidia.com/signup) for and setup the NVIDIA GPU Cloud (NGC)
Registry CLI. Further documentation for downloading models can be found in the [NGC documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/dgx/ngc-registry-cli-user-guide/index.html#topic_6_4_1).

Alternatively, you can directly download the checkpoints using:

> BERT-345M-uncased:

```python

```

```bash
wget --content-disposition https://api.ngc.nvidia.com/v2/models/nvidia/megatron_bert_345m/versions/v0.1_uncased/zip
-O megatron_bert_345m_v0_1_uncased.zip
```

> BERT-345M-cased:

```python

```

```bash
wget --content-disposition https://api.ngc.nvidia.com/v2/models/nvidia/megatron_bert_345m/versions/v0.1_cased/zip -O
megatron_bert_345m_v0_1_cased.zip
```

Once you have obtained the checkpoints from NVIDIA GPU Cloud (NGC), you have to convert them to a format that will
easily be loaded by Hugging Face Transformers and our port of the BERT code.

The following commands allow you to do the conversion. We assume that the folder `models/megatron_bert` contains
> `megatron_bert_345m_v0_1_&amp;lcub;cased, uncased}.zip` and that the commands are run from inside that folder:

```python

```

```bash
python3 $PATH_TO_TRANSFORMERS/models/megatron_bert/convert_megatron_bert_checkpoint.py megatron_bert_345m_v0_1_uncased.zip
```

```bash
python3 $PATH_TO_TRANSFORMERS/models/megatron_bert/convert_megatron_bert_checkpoint.py megatron_bert_345m_v0_1_cased.zip
```

This model was contributed by [jdemouth](https://huggingface.co/jdemouth). The original code can be found [here](https://github.com/NVIDIA/Megatron-LM). That repository contains a multi-GPU and multi-node implementation of the
Megatron Language models. In particular, it contains a hybrid model parallel approach using "tensor parallel" and
"pipeline parallel" techniques.

> **class transformers.MegatronBertConfig**(vocab_size = 29056, hidden_size = 1024, num_hidden_layers = 24, num_attention_heads = 16, intermediate_size = 4096, hidden_act = 'gelu', hidden_dropout_prob = 0.1, attention_probs_dropout_prob = 0.1, max_position_embeddings = 512, type_vocab_size = 2, initializer_range = 0.02, layer_norm_eps = 1e-12, pad_token_id = 0, position_embedding_type = 'absolute', use_cache = True, **kwargs)


This is the configuration class to store the configuration of a [MegatronBertModel](/docs/transformers/master/en/model_doc/megatron_bert.html#transformers.MegatronBertModel). It is
used to instantiate a MEGATRON_BERT model according to the specified arguments, defining the model architecture.
Instantiating a configuration with the defaults will yield a similar configuration to that of the MEGATRON_BERT
[megatron-bert-uncased-345m](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/megatron-bert-uncased-345m) architecture.

Configuration objects inherit from [PretrainedConfig](/docs/transformers/master/en/main_classes/configuration.html#transformers.PretrainedConfig) and can be used to control the model
outputs. Read the documentation from [PretrainedConfig](/docs/transformers/master/en/main_classes/configuration.html#transformers.PretrainedConfig) for more information.

```


## [MegatronBertModel](#megatronbertmodel)

<a id='transformers.MegatronBertModel'></a>
> **class transformers.MegatronBertModel**(config, add_pooling_layer = True)

The bare MegatronBert Model transformer outputting raw hidden-states without any specific head on top.

This model inherits from [PreTrainedModel](/docs/transformers/master/en/main_classes/model.html#transformers.PreTrainedModel). Check the superclass documentation for the generic
methods the library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input embeddings,
pruning heads etc.)

This model is also a PyTorch [torch.nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module)
subclass. Use it as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to
general usage and behavior.

> Parameters

- **config** ([MegatronBertConfig](/docs/transformers/master/en/model_doc/megatron_bert.html#transformers.MegatronBertConfig)) -- Model configuration class with all the parameters of the model.
  Initializing with a config file does not load the weights associated with the model, only the
  configuration. Check out the [from_pretrained()](/docs/transformers/master/en/main_classes/model.html#transformers.PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained) method to load the model
  weights.


  The model can behave as an encoder (with only self-attention) as well as a decoder, in which case a layer of
  cross-attention is added between the self-attention layers, following the architecture described in [Attention is
  all you need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) by Ashish Vaswani, Noam Shazeer, Niki Parmar, Jakob Uszkoreit,
  Llion Jones, Aidan N. Gomez, Lukasz Kaiser and Illia Polosukhin.

  To behave as an decoder the model needs to be initialized with the `is_decoder` argument of the configuration
  set to `True`. To be used in a Seq2Seq model, the model needs to initialized with both `is_decoder`
  argument and `add_cross_attention` set to `True`; an `encoder_hidden_states` is then expected as an
  input to the forward pass.


<a id='transformers.MegatronBertModel.forward'></a>
> **forward**(self, input_ids = None, attention_mask = None, token_type_ids = None, position_ids = None, head_mask = None, inputs_embeds = None, encoder_hidden_states = None, encoder_attention_mask = None, past_key_values = None, use_cache = None, output_attentions = None, output_hidden_states = None, return_dict = None)

The [MegatronBertModel](/docs/transformers/master/en/model_doc/megatron_bert.html#transformers.MegatronBertModel) forward method, overrides the `__call__` special method.

<Tip>

Although the recipe for forward pass needs to be defined within this function, one should call the
`Module` instance afterwards instead of this since the former takes care of running the pre and post
processing steps while the latter silently ignores them.

</Tip>

> Parameters

- **input_ids** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`) --
  Indices of input sequence tokens in the vocabulary.

  Indices can be obtained using [BertTokenizer](/docs/transformers/master/en/model_doc/bert.html#transformers.BertTokenizer). See
  [transformers.PreTrainedTokenizer.encode()](/docs/transformers/master/en/internal/tokenization_utils.html#transformers.PreTrainedTokenizerBase.encode) and [transformers.PreTrainedTokenizer.__call__()](/docs/transformers/master/en/internal/tokenization_utils.html#transformers.PreTrainedTokenizerBase.__call__) for
  details.

  - 0 for tokens that are **masked**.

  [What are attention masks?](../glossary.html#attention-mask)
- **token_type_ids** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, _optional_) --
  Segment token indices to indicate first and second portions of the inputs. Indices are selected in `[0, 1]`:

  Mask to nullify selected heads of the self-attention modules. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:

  - 1 indicates the head is **not masked**,
  - 0 indicates the head is **masked**.

- **inputs_embeds** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`, _optional_) --
  Optionally, instead of passing `input_ids` you can choose to directly pass an embedded representation.
  This is useful if you want more control over how to convert `input_ids` indices into associated
  vectors than the model's internal embedding lookup matrix.
- **output_attentions** (`bool`, _optional_) --
  Whether or not to return the attentions tensors of all attention layers. See `attentions` under returned
  tensors for more detail.
- **output_hidden_states** (`bool`, _optional_) --

  more detail.
- **return_dict** (`bool`, _optional_) --

- **encoder_hidden_states**  (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`, _optional_) --
  Sequence of hidden-states at the output of the last layer of the encoder. Used in the cross-attention if
  the model is configured as a decoder.
- **encoder_attention_mask** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, _optional_) --
  Mask to avoid performing attention on the padding token indices of the encoder input. This mask is used in
  the cross-attention if the model is configured as a decoder. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:

  - 1 for tokens that are **not masked**,
  - 0 for tokens that are **masked**.
- **past_key_values** (`tuple(tuple(torch.FloatTensor))` of length `config.n_layers` with each tuple having 4 tensors of shape `(batch_size, num_heads, sequence_length - 1, embed_size_per_head)`) --
  Contains precomputed key and value hidden states of the attention blocks. Can be used to speed up decoding.

  If `past_key_values` are used, the user can optionally input only the last `decoder_input_ids`
  (those that don't have their past key value states given to this model) of shape `(batch_size, 1)`
  instead of all `decoder_input_ids` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`.
- **use_cache** (`bool`, _optional_) --
  If set to `True`, `past_key_values` key value states are returned and can be used to speed up
  decoding (see `past_key_values`).

> Returns

A [BaseModelOutputWithPoolingAndCrossAttentions](/docs/transformers/master/en/main_classes/output.html#transformers.modeling_outputs.BaseModelOutputWithPoolingAndCrossAttentions) or a tuple of

- **pooler_output** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, hidden_size)`) -- Last layer hidden-state of the first token of the sequence (classification token) after further processing
  through the layers used for the auxiliary pretraining task. E.g. for BERT-family of models, this returns
  the classification token after processing through a linear layer and a tanh activation function. The linear
  layer weights are trained from the next sentence prediction (classification) objective during pretraining.
- **hidden_states** (`tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`, _optional_, returned when `output_hidden_states=True` is passed or when `config.output_hidden_states=True`) -- Tuple of `torch.FloatTensor` (one for the output of the embeddings + one for the output of each layer)
  of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`.

  Hidden-states of the model at the output of each layer plus the initial embedding outputs.
- **attentions** (`tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`, _optional_, returned when `output_attentions=True` is passed or when `config.output_attentions=True`) -- Tuple of `torch.FloatTensor` (one for each layer) of shape `(batch_size, num_heads, sequence_length, sequence_length)`.

  `config.is_encoder_decoder=True` 2 additional tensors of shape `(batch_size, num_heads, encoder_sequence_length, embed_size_per_head)`.

  Contains pre-computed hidden-states (key and values in the self-attention blocks and optionally if
  `config.is_encoder_decoder=True` in the cross-attention blocks) that can be used (see
  `past_key_values` input) to speed up sequential decoding.

## [MegatronBertForCausalLM](#megatronbertforcausallm)

<a id='transformers.MegatronBertForCausalLM'></a>
> **class transformers.MegatronBertForCausalLM**(config)

MegatronBert Model with a _language modeling_ head on top for CLM fine-tuning. 

This model inherits from [PreTrainedModel](/docs/transformers/master/en/main_classes/model.html#transformers.PreTrainedModel). Check the superclass documentation for the generic
methods the library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input embeddings,
pruning heads etc.)

This model is also a PyTorch [torch.nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module)
subclass. Use it as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to
general usage and behavior.

> Parameters

- **config** ([MegatronBertConfig](/docs/transformers/master/en/model_doc/megatron_bert.html#transformers.MegatronBertConfig)) -- Model configuration class with all the parameters of the model.
  Initializing with a config file does not load the weights associated with the model, only the
  configuration. Check out the [from_pretrained()](/docs/transformers/master/en/main_classes/model.html#transformers.PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained) method to load the model
  weights.


<a id='transformers.MegatronBertForCausalLM.forward'></a>
> **forward**(self, input_ids = None, attention_mask = None, token_type_ids = None, position_ids = None, head_mask = None, inputs_embeds = None, encoder_hidden_states = None, encoder_attention_mask = None, labels = None, past_key_values = None, use_cache = None, output_attentions = None, output_hidden_states = None, return_dict = None)

The [MegatronBertForCausalLM](/docs/transformers/master/en/model_doc/megatron_bert.html#transformers.MegatronBertForCausalLM) forward method, overrides the `__call__` special method.

<Tip>

Although the recipe for forward pass needs to be defined within this function, one should call the
`Module` instance afterwards instead of this since the former takes care of running the pre and post
processing steps while the latter silently ignores them.

</Tip>

> Parameters

- **input_ids** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`) --
  Indices of input sequence tokens in the vocabulary.

  Indices can be obtained using [BertTokenizer](/docs/transformers/master/en/model_doc/bert.html#transformers.BertTokenizer). See
  [transformers.PreTrainedTokenizer.encode()](/docs/transformers/master/en/internal/tokenization_utils.html#transformers.PreTrainedTokenizerBase.encode) and [transformers.PreTrainedTokenizer.__call__()](/docs/transformers/master/en/internal/tokenization_utils.html#transformers.PreTrainedTokenizerBase.__call__) for
  details.

  [What are input IDs?](../glossary.html#input-ids)
- **attention_mask** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, _optional_) --
  Mask to avoid performing attention on padding token indices. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:

  - 1 for tokens that are **not masked**,
  - 0 for tokens that are **masked**.

  [What are attention masks?](../glossary.html#attention-mask)
- **token_type_ids** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, _optional_) --
  Segment token indices to indicate first and second portions of the inputs. Indices are selected in `[0, 1]`:

  - 0 corresponds to a _sentence A_ token,
  - 1 corresponds to a _sentence B_ token.

  [What are token type IDs?](../glossary.html#token-type-ids)
- **position_ids** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, _optional_) --
  Indices of positions of each input sequence tokens in the position embeddings. Selected in the range `[0, config.max_position_embeddings - 1]`.

  [What are position IDs?](../glossary.html#position-ids)
- **head_mask** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(num_heads,)` or `(num_layers, num_heads)`, _optional_) --
  Mask to nullify selected heads of the self-attention modules. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:

  - 1 indicates the head is **not masked**,
  - 0 indicates the head is **masked**.

- **inputs_embeds** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`, _optional_) --
  Optionally, instead of passing `input_ids` you can choose to directly pass an embedded representation.
  This is useful if you want more control over how to convert `input_ids` indices into associated
  vectors than the model's internal embedding lookup matrix.
- **output_attentions** (`bool`, _optional_) --
  Whether or not to return the attentions tensors of all attention layers. See `attentions` under returned
  tensors for more detail.
- **output_hidden_states** (`bool`, _optional_) --
  Whether or not to return the hidden states of all layers. See `hidden_states` under returned tensors for
  more detail.
- **return_dict** (`bool`, _optional_) --
  Whether or not to return a [ModelOutput](/docs/transformers/master/en/main_classes/output.html#transformers.file_utils.ModelOutput) instead of a plain tuple.

- **encoder_hidden_states**  (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`, _optional_) --
  Sequence of hidden-states at the output of the last layer of the encoder. Used in the cross-attention if
  the model is configured as a decoder.
- **encoder_attention_mask** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, _optional_) --
  Mask to avoid performing attention on the padding token indices of the encoder input. This mask is used in
  the cross-attention if the model is configured as a decoder. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:

  - 1 for tokens that are **not masked**,
  - 0 for tokens that are **masked**.
- **labels** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, _optional_) --
  Labels for computing the left-to-right language modeling loss (next word prediction). Indices should be in
  `[-100, 0, ..., config.vocab_size]` (see `input_ids` docstring) Tokens with indices set to `-100` are
  ignored (masked), the loss is only computed for the tokens with labels n `[0, ..., config.vocab_size]`
- **past_key_values** (`tuple(tuple(torch.FloatTensor))` of length `config.n_layers` with each tuple having 4 tensors of shape `(batch_size, num_heads, sequence_length - 1, embed_size_per_head)`) --
  Contains precomputed key and value hidden states of the attention blocks. Can be used to speed up decoding.

  If `past_key_values` are used, the user can optionally input only the last `decoder_input_ids`
  (those that don't have their past key value states given to this model) of shape `(batch_size, 1)`
  instead of all `decoder_input_ids` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`.
- **use_cache** (`bool`, _optional_) --
  If set to `True`, `past_key_values` key value states are returned and can be used to speed up
  decoding (see `past_key_values`).

> **class transformers.MegatronBertForSequenceClassification**(config)


MegatronBert Model transformer with a sequence classification/regression head on top (a linear layer on top of the
pooled output) e.g. for GLUE tasks.


This model inherits from [PreTrainedModel](/docs/transformers/master/en/main_classes/model.html#transformers.PreTrainedModel). Check the superclass documentation for the generic
methods the library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input embeddings,

> Parameters

- **config** ([MegatronBertConfig](/docs/transformers/master/en/model_doc/megatron_bert.html#transformers.MegatronBertConfig)) -- Model configuration class with all the parameters of the model.
  Initializing with a config file does not load the weights associated with the model, only the

## [MegatronBertForMultipleChoice](#megatronbertformultiplechoice)

<a id='transformers.MegatronBertForMultipleChoice'></a>
> **class transformers.MegatronBertForMultipleChoice**(config)


MegatronBert Model with a multiple choice classification head on top (a linear layer on top of the pooled output
and a softmax) e.g. for RocStories/SWAG tasks.


This model inherits from [PreTrainedModel](/docs/transformers/master/en/main_classes/model.html#transformers.PreTrainedModel). Check the superclass documentation for the generic
methods the library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input embeddings,
pruning heads etc.)

This model is also a PyTorch [torch.nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module)
subclass. Use it as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to
general usage and behavior.

> Parameters

- **config** ([MegatronBertConfig](/docs/transformers/master/en/model_doc/megatron_bert.html#transformers.MegatronBertConfig)) -- Model configuration class with all the parameters of the model.
  Initializing with a config file does not load the weights associated with the model, only the
  configuration. Check out the [from_pretrained()](/docs/transformers/master/en/main_classes/model.html#transformers.PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained) method to load the model
  weights.
