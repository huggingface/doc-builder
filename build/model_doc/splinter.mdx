# Splinter

## Overview

The Splinter model was proposed in [Few-Shot Question Answering by Pretraining Span Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.00438) by Ori Ram, Yuval Kirstain, Jonathan Berant, Amir Globerson, Omer Levy. Splinter
is an encoder-only transformer (similar to BERT) pretrained using the recurring span selection task on a large corpus
comprising Wikipedia and the Toronto Book Corpus.

The abstract from the paper is the following:

In several question answering benchmarks, pretrained models have reached human parity through fine-tuning on an order
of 100,000 annotated questions and answers. We explore the more realistic few-shot setting, where only a few hundred
training examples are available, and observe that standard models perform poorly, highlighting the discrepancy between
current pretraining objectives and question answering. We propose a new pretraining scheme tailored for question
answering: recurring span selection. Given a passage with multiple sets of recurring spans, we mask in each set all
recurring spans but one, and ask the model to select the correct span in the passage for each masked span. Masked spans
are replaced with a special token, viewed as a question representation, that is later used during fine-tuning to select
the answer span. The resulting model obtains surprisingly good results on multiple benchmarks (e.g., 72.7 F1 on SQuAD
with only 128 training examples), while maintaining competitive performance in the high-resource setting.

Tips:

- Splinter was trained to predict answers spans conditioned on a special [QUESTION] token. These tokens contextualize
  to question representations which are used to predict the answers. This layer is called QASS, and is the default
  behaviour in the [SplinterForQuestionAnswering](model_doc/splinter.html#transformers.SplinterForQuestionAnswering) class. Therefore:
- Use [SplinterTokenizer](model_doc/splinter.html#transformers.SplinterTokenizer) (rather than [BertTokenizer](model_doc/bert.html#transformers.BertTokenizer)), as it already
  contains this special token. Also, its default behavior is to use this token when two sequences are given (for
  example, in the _run_qa.py_ script).
- If you plan on using Splinter outside _run_qa.py_, please keep in mind the question token - it might be important for
  the success of your model, especially in a few-shot setting.
- Please note there are two different checkpoints for each size of Splinter. Both are basically the same, except that
  one also has the pretrained wights of the QASS layer (_tau/splinter-base-qass_ and _tau/splinter-large-qass_) and one
  doesn't (_tau/splinter-base_ and _tau/splinter-large_). This is done to support randomly initializing this layer at
  fine-tuning, as it is shown to yield better results for some cases in the paper.

This model was contributed by [yuvalkirstain](https://huggingface.co/yuvalkirstain) and [oriram](https://huggingface.co/oriram). The original code can be found [here](https://github.com/oriram/splinter).

This is the configuration class to store the configuration of a [SplinterModel](model_doc/splinter.html#transformers.SplinterModel). It is used to
instantiate an Splinter model according to the specified arguments, defining the model architecture. Instantiating
a configuration with the defaults will yield a similar configuration to that of the Splinter [tau/splinter-base](https://huggingface.co/tau/splinter-base) architecture.

Configuration objects inherit from [PretrainedConfig](main_classes/configuration.html#transformers.PretrainedConfig) and can be used to control the model
outputs. Read the documentation from [PretrainedConfig](main_classes/configuration.html#transformers.PretrainedConfig) for more information.

## SplinterModel

<a id='transformers.SplinterModel'></a>
> **class transformers.SplinterModel**(config)

The bare Splinter Model transformer outputting raw hidden-states without any specific head on top.
This model is a PyTorch [torch.nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module) sub-class. Use
it as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to general usage and
behavior.

> Parameters

- **config** ([SplinterConfig](model_doc/splinter.html#transformers.SplinterConfig)) -- Model configuration class with all the parameters of the model.
  Initializing with a config file does not load the weights associated with the model, only the
  configuration. Check out the [from_pretrained()](main_classes/model.html#transformers.PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained) method to load the model
  weights.

  The model is an encoder (with only self-attention) following the architecture described in [Attention is all you
  need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) by Ashish Vaswani, Noam Shazeer, Niki Parmar, Jakob Uszkoreit, Llion
  Jones, Aidan N. Gomez, Lukasz Kaiser and Illia Polosukhin.


<a id='transformers.SplinterModel.forward'></a>
> **forward**(self, input_ids = None, attention_mask = None, token_type_ids = None, position_ids = None, head_mask = None, inputs_embeds = None, encoder_hidden_states = None, encoder_attention_mask = None, past_key_values = None, use_cache = None, output_attentions = None, output_hidden_states = None, return_dict = None)

The [SplinterModel](model_doc/splinter.html#transformers.SplinterModel) forward method, overrides the `__call__` special method.

<Tip>

Although the recipe for forward pass needs to be defined within this function, one should call the
`Module` instance afterwards instead of this since the former takes care of running the pre and post
processing steps while the latter silently ignores them.

</Tip>

> Parameters

- **input_ids** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`) --
  Indices of input sequence tokens in the vocabulary.

  - 0 for tokens that are **masked**.

  [What are attention masks?](../glossary.html#attention-mask)
- **token_type_ids** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `batch_size, sequence_length`, _optional_) --

  Mask to nullify selected heads of the self-attention modules. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:

  - 1 indicates the head is **not masked**,
  - 0 indicates the head is **masked**.

- **inputs_embeds** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`, _optional_) --
  Optionally, instead of passing `input_ids` you can choose to directly pass an embedded representation.
  This is useful if you want more control over how to convert _input_ids_ indices into associated vectors
  than the model's internal embedding lookup matrix.

  Whether or not to return the attentions tensors of all attention layers. See `attentions` under returned
  tensors for more detail.

  Sequence of hidden-states at the output of the last layer of the encoder. Used in the cross-attention if
  the model is configured as a decoder.
- **encoder_attention_mask** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, _optional_) --
  Mask to avoid performing attention on the padding token indices of the encoder input. This mask is used in
  the cross-attention if the model is configured as a decoder. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:

  - 0 for tokens that are **masked**.
- **past_key_values** (`tuple(tuple(torch.FloatTensor))` of length `config.n_layers` with each tuple having 4 tensors of shape `(batch_size, num_heads, sequence_length - 1, embed_size_per_head)`) --
  Contains precomputed key and value hidden states of the attention blocks. Can be used to speed up decoding.
  If `past_key_values` are used, the user can optionally input only the last `decoder_input_ids`
  (those that don't have their past key value states given to this model) of shape `(batch_size, 1)`
  instead of all `decoder_input_ids` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`.
- **use_cache** (`bool`, _optional_) --
  If set to `True`, `past_key_values` key value states are returned and can be used to speed up
  decoding (see `past_key_values`).

> Returns

A [BaseModelOutputWithPastAndCrossAttentions](main_classes/output.html#transformers.modeling_outputs.BaseModelOutputWithPastAndCrossAttentions) or a tuple of

  `config.is_encoder_decoder=True` 2 additional tensors of shape `(batch_size, num_heads, encoder_sequence_length, embed_size_per_head)`.

  Contains pre-computed hidden-states (key and values in the self-attention blocks and optionally if
  `config.is_encoder_decoder=True` in the cross-attention blocks) that can be used (see
  `past_key_values` input) to speed up sequential decoding.
- **hidden_states** (`tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`, _optional_, returned when `output_hidden_states=True` is passed or when `config.output_hidden_states=True`) -- Tuple of `torch.FloatTensor` (one for the output of the embeddings + one for the output of each layer)

## SplinterForQuestionAnswering

<a id='transformers.SplinterForQuestionAnswering'></a>
> **class transformers.SplinterForQuestionAnswering**(config)


Splinter Model with a span classification head on top for extractive question-answering tasks like SQuAD (a linear
layers on top of the hidden-states output to compute _span start logits_ and _span end logits_).

This model is a PyTorch [torch.nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module) sub-class. Use
it as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to general usage and
behavior.

> Parameters

- **config** ([SplinterConfig](model_doc/splinter.html#transformers.SplinterConfig)) -- Model configuration class with all the parameters of the model.
  Initializing with a config file does not load the weights associated with the model, only the
  configuration. Check out the [from_pretrained()](main_classes/model.html#transformers.PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained) method to load the model
  weights.


<a id='transformers.SplinterForQuestionAnswering.forward'></a>
> **forward**(self, input_ids = None, attention_mask = None, token_type_ids = None, position_ids = None, head_mask = None, inputs_embeds = None, start_positions = None, end_positions = None, output_attentions = None, output_hidden_states = None, return_dict = None, question_positions = None)

The [SplinterForQuestionAnswering](model_doc/splinter.html#transformers.SplinterForQuestionAnswering) forward method, overrides the `__call__` special method.

<Tip>

Although the recipe for forward pass needs to be defined within this function, one should call the
`Module` instance afterwards instead of this since the former takes care of running the pre and post
processing steps while the latter silently ignores them.

</Tip>

> Parameters

- **input_ids** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`) --
  Indices of input sequence tokens in the vocabulary.

  Indices can be obtained using [transformers.SplinterTokenizer](model_doc/splinter.html#transformers.SplinterTokenizer). See
  [transformers.PreTrainedTokenizer.encode()](internal/tokenization_utils.html#transformers.PreTrainedTokenizerBase.encode) and [transformers.PreTrainedTokenizer.__call__()](internal/tokenization_utils.html#transformers.PreTrainedTokenizerBase.__call__) for
  details.

  [What are input IDs?](../glossary.html#input-ids)
- **attention_mask** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `batch_size, sequence_length`, _optional_) --
  Mask to avoid performing attention on padding token indices. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:

  - 1 for tokens that are **not masked**,
  - 0 for tokens that are **masked**.

  [What are attention masks?](../glossary.html#attention-mask)
- **token_type_ids** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `batch_size, sequence_length`, _optional_) --
  Segment token indices to indicate first and second portions of the inputs. Indices are selected in `[0, 1]`:

  - 0 corresponds to a _sentence A_ token,
  - 1 corresponds to a _sentence B_ token.

  [What are token type IDs?](../glossary.html#token-type-ids)
- **position_ids** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `batch_size, sequence_length`, _optional_) --
  Indices of positions of each input sequence tokens in the position embeddings. Selected in the range `[0, config.max_position_embeddings - 1]`.

  [What are position IDs?](../glossary.html#position-ids)
- **head_mask** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(num_heads,)` or `(num_layers, num_heads)`, _optional_) --
  Mask to nullify selected heads of the self-attention modules. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:

  - 1 indicates the head is **not masked**,
  - 0 indicates the head is **masked**.

- **inputs_embeds** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`, _optional_) --
  Optionally, instead of passing `input_ids` you can choose to directly pass an embedded representation.
  This is useful if you want more control over how to convert _input_ids_ indices into associated vectors
  than the model's internal embedding lookup matrix.
- **output_attentions** (`bool`, _optional_) --
  Whether or not to return the attentions tensors of all attention layers. See `attentions` under returned
  tensors for more detail.
- **output_hidden_states** (`bool`, _optional_) --
  Whether or not to return the hidden states of all layers. See `hidden_states` under returned tensors for
  more detail.
- **return_dict** (`bool`, _optional_) --
  Whether or not to return a [ModelOutput](main_classes/output.html#transformers.file_utils.ModelOutput) instead of a plain tuple.

- **start_positions** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size,)`, _optional_) --
  Labels for position (index) of the start of the labelled span for computing the token classification loss.
  Positions are clamped to the length of the sequence (`sequence_length`). Position outside of the
  sequence are not taken into account for computing the loss.
- **end_positions** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size,)`, _optional_) --
  Labels for position (index) of the end of the labelled span for computing the token classification loss.
  Positions are clamped to the length of the sequence (`sequence_length`). Position outside of the
  sequence are not taken into account for computing the loss.
- **question_positions** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, num_questions)`, _optional_) --
  The positions of all question tokens. If given, start_logits and end_logits will be of shape
  `(batch_size, num_questions, sequence_length)`. If None, the first question token in each sequence in
  the batch will be the only one for which start_logits and end_logits are calculated and they will be of
  shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`.

> Returns

A [QuestionAnsweringModelOutput](main_classes/output.html#transformers.modeling_outputs.QuestionAnsweringModelOutput) or a tuple of
`torch.FloatTensor` (if `return_dict=False` is passed or when `config.return_dict=False`) comprising
various elements depending on the configuration ([SplinterConfig](model_doc/splinter.html#transformers.SplinterConfig)) and inputs.

- **loss** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(1,)`, _optional_, returned when `labels` is provided) -- Total span extraction loss is the sum of a Cross-Entropy for the start and end positions.
- **start_logits** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`) -- Span-start scores (before SoftMax).
- **end_logits** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`) -- Span-end scores (before SoftMax).
- **hidden_states** (`tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`, _optional_, returned when `output_hidden_states=True` is passed or when `config.output_hidden_states=True`) -- Tuple of `torch.FloatTensor` (one for the output of the embeddings + one for the output of each layer)
  of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`.

  Hidden-states of the model at the output of each layer plus the initial embedding outputs.
- **attentions** (`tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`, _optional_, returned when `output_attentions=True` is passed or when `config.output_attentions=True`) -- Tuple of `torch.FloatTensor` (one for each layer) of shape `(batch_size, num_heads, sequence_length, sequence_length)`.

  Attentions weights after the attention softmax, used to compute the weighted average in the self-attention
  heads.

> Return type

[QuestionAnsweringModelOutput](main_classes/output.html#transformers.modeling_outputs.QuestionAnsweringModelOutput) or `tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`
