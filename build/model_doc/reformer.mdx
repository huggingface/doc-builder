# Reformer

**DISCLAIMER:** This model is still a work in progress, if you see something strange, file a [Github Issue](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug-report.md&title).

## Overview

The Reformer model was proposed in the paper [Reformer: The Efficient Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04451.pdf) by Nikita Kitaev, ≈Åukasz Kaiser, Anselm Levskaya.

The abstract from the paper is the following:

*Large Transformer models routinely achieve state-of-the-art results on a number of tasks but training these models can
be prohibitively costly, especially on long sequences. We introduce two techniques to improve the efficiency of
Transformers. For one, we replace dot-product attention by one that uses locality-sensitive hashing, changing its
complexity from O(L^2) to O(Llog(L)), where L is the length of the sequence. Furthermore, we use reversible residual
layers instead of the standard residuals, which allows storing activations only once in the training process instead of
N times, where N is the number of layers. The resulting model, the Reformer, performs on par with Transformer models
while being much more memory-efficient and much faster on long sequences.*

This model was contributed by [patrickvonplaten](https://huggingface.co/patrickvonplaten). The Authors' code can be
found [here](https://github.com/google/trax/tree/master/trax/models/reformer).

## Axial Positional Encodings

Axial Positional Encodings were first implemented in Google's [trax library](https://github.com/google/trax/blob/4d99ad4965bab1deba227539758d59f0df0fef48/trax/layers/research/position_encodings.py#L29)
and developed by the authors of this model's paper. In models that are treating very long input sequences, the
conventional position id encodings store an embedings vector of size \\(d\\) being the `config.hidden_size` for
every position \\(i, \ldots, n_s\\), with \\(n_s\\) being `config.max_embedding_size`. This means that having
a sequence length of \\(n_s = 2^&lcub19} \approx 0.5M\\) and a `config.hidden_size` of \\(d = 2^&lcub10} \approx 1000\\)
would result in a position encoding matrix:

$$X_&lcubi,j}, \text&lcub with } i \in \left[1,\ldots, d\right] \text&lcub and } j \in \left[1,\ldots, n_s\right]$$

which alone has over 500M parameters to store. Axial positional encodings factorize \\(X_&lcubi,j}\\) into two matrices:

$$X^&lcub1}_&lcubi,j}, \text&lcub with } i \in \left[1,\ldots, d^1\right] \text&lcub and } j \in \left[1,\ldots, n_s^1\right]$$

and

$$X^&lcub2}_&lcubi,j}, \text&lcub with } i \in \left[1,\ldots, d^2\right] \text&lcub and } j \in \left[1,\ldots, n_s^2\right]$$

with:

$$d = d^1 + d^2 \text&lcub and } n_s = n_s^1 \times n_s^2 .$$

Therefore the following holds:

$$X_&lcubi,j} = \begin&lcubcases}
X^&lcub1}_&lcubi, k}, & \text&lcubif }\ i &amp;lt; d^1 \text&lcub with } k = j \mod n_s^1 \\
X^&lcub2}_&lcubi - d^1, l}, & \text&lcubif } i \ge d^1 \text&lcub with } l = \lfloor\frac&lcubj}&lcubn_s^1}\rfloor
\end&lcubcases}$$

Intuitively, this means that a position embedding vector \\(x_j \in \mathbb&lcubR}^&lcubd}\\) is now the composition of two
factorized embedding vectors: \\(x^1_&lcubk, l} + x^2_&lcubl, k}\\), where as the `config.max_embedding_size` dimension
\\(j\\) is factorized into \\(k \text&lcub and } l\\). This design ensures that each position embedding vector
\\(x_j\\) is unique.

Using the above example again, axial position encoding with \\(d^1 = 2^5, d^2 = 2^5, n_s^1 = 2^9, n_s^2 = 2^&lcub10}\\)
can drastically reduced the number of parameters to \\(2^&lcub14} + 2^&lcub15} \approx 49000\\) parameters.

In practice, the parameter `config.axial_pos_embds_dim` is set to a tuple \\((d^1, d^2)\\) which sum has to be
equal to `config.hidden_size` and `config.axial_pos_shape` is set to a tuple \\((n_s^1, n_s^2)\\) which
product has to be equal to `config.max_embedding_size`, which during training has to be equal to the _sequence
length_ of the `input_ids`.


## LSH Self Attention

In Locality sensitive hashing (LSH) self attention the key and query projection weights are tied. Therefore, the key
query embedding vectors are also tied. LSH self attention uses the locality sensitive hashing mechanism proposed in
[Practical and Optimal LSH for Angular Distance](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.02897) to assign each of the tied key
query embedding vectors to one of `config.num_buckets` possible buckets. The premise is that the more "similar"
key query embedding vectors (in terms of *cosine similarity*) are to each other, the more likely they are assigned to
the same bucket.

The accuracy of the LSH mechanism can be improved by increasing `config.num_hashes` or directly the argument
`num_hashes` of the forward function so that the output of the LSH self attention better approximates the output
of the "normal" full self attention. The buckets are then sorted and chunked into query key embedding vector chunks
each of length `config.lsh_chunk_length`. For each chunk, the query embedding vectors attend to its key vectors
(which are tied to themselves) and to the key embedding vectors of `config.lsh_num_chunks_before` previous
neighboring chunks and `config.lsh_num_chunks_after` following neighboring chunks.

For more information, see the [original Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04451) or this great [blog post](https://www.pragmatic.ml/reformer-deep-dive/).

Note that `config.num_buckets` can also be factorized into a list \\((n_&lcub\text&lcubbuckets}}^1,
n_&lcub\text&lcubbuckets}}^2)\\). This way instead of assigning the query key embedding vectors to one of \\((1,\ldots,
n_&lcub\text&lcubbuckets}})\\) they are assigned to one of \\((1-1,\ldots, n_&lcub\text&lcubbuckets}}^1-1, \ldots,
1-n_&lcub\text&lcubbuckets}}^2, \ldots, n_&lcub\text&lcubbuckets}}^1-n_&lcub\text&lcubbuckets}}^2)\\). This is crucial for very long sequences to
save memory.

When training a model from scratch, it is recommended to leave `config.num_buckets=None`, so that depending on the
sequence length a good value for `num_buckets` is calculated on the fly. This value will then automatically be
saved in the config and should be reused for inference.

Using LSH self attention, the memory and time complexity of the query-key matmul operation can be reduced from
\\(\mathcal&lcubO}(n_s \times n_s)\\) to \\(\mathcal&lcubO}(n_s \times \log(n_s))\\), which usually represents the memory
and time bottleneck in a transformer model, with \\(n_s\\) being the sequence length.


## Local Self Attention

Local self attention is essentially a "normal" self attention layer with key, query and value projections, but is
chunked so that in each chunk of length `config.local_chunk_length` the query embedding vectors only attends to
the key embedding vectors in its chunk and to the key embedding vectors of `config.local_num_chunks_before`
previous neighboring chunks and `config.local_num_chunks_after` following neighboring chunks.

Using Local self attention, the memory and time complexity of the query-key matmul operation can be reduced from
\\(\mathcal&lcubO}(n_s \times n_s)\\) to \\(\mathcal&lcubO}(n_s \times \log(n_s))\\), which usually represents the memory
and time bottleneck in a transformer model, with \\(n_s\\) being the sequence length.


## Training

During training, we must ensure that the sequence length is set to a value that can be divided by the least common
multiple of `config.lsh_chunk_length` and `config.local_chunk_length` and that the parameters of the Axial
Positional Encodings are correctly set as described above. Reformer is very memory efficient so that the model can
easily be trained on sequences as long as 64000 tokens.

For training, the [ReformerModelWithLMHead](model_doc/reformer.html#transformers.ReformerModelWithLMHead) should be used as follows:

```
input_ids = tokenizer.encode('This is a sentence from the training data', return_tensors='pt')
loss = model(input_ids, labels=input_ids)[0]
```

## ReformerModel

<a id='transformers.ReformerModel'></a>
> **class transformers.ReformerModel**(config)

The bare Reformer Model transformer outputting raw hidden-stateswithout any specific head on top.
Reformer was proposed in [Reformer: The Efficient Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04451) by Nikita
Kitaev, ≈Åukasz Kaiser, Anselm Levskaya.

This model inherits from [PreTrainedModel](main_classes/model.html#transformers.PreTrainedModel). Check the superclass documentation for the generic
methods the library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input embeddings,
pruning heads etc.)

This model is also a PyTorch [torch.nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module)
subclass. Use it as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to
general usage and behavior.

> Parameters

- **config** ([ReformerConfig](model_doc/reformer.html#transformers.ReformerConfig)) -- Model configuration class with all the parameters of the model.
  Initializing with a config file does not load the weights associated with the model, only the
  configuration. Check out the [from_pretrained()](main_classes/model.html#transformers.PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained) method to load the model
  weights.


<a id='transformers.ReformerModel.forward'></a>
> **forward**(self, input_ids = None, attention_mask = None, position_ids = None, head_mask = None, inputs_embeds = None, num_hashes = None, past_buckets_states = None, use_cache = None, output_hidden_states = None, output_attentions = None, return_dict = None)

The [ReformerModel](model_doc/reformer.html#transformers.ReformerModel) forward method, overrides the `__call__` special method.

<Tip>

Although the recipe for forward pass needs to be defined within this function, one should call the
`Module` instance afterwards instead of this since the former takes care of running the pre and post
processing steps while the latter silently ignores them.

</Tip>

> Parameters

- **input_ids** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`) --
  Indices of input sequence tokens in the vocabulary. During training the input_ids sequence_length has to be
  a multiple of the relevant model's chunk lengths (lsh's, local's or both). During evaluation, the indices
  are automatically padded to be a multiple of the chunk length.

  Indices can be obtained using [ReformerTokenizer](model_doc/reformer.html#transformers.ReformerTokenizer). See
  [transformers.PreTrainedTokenizer.encode()](internal/tokenization_utils.html#transformers.PreTrainedTokenizerBase.encode) and [transformers.PreTrainedTokenizer.__call__()](internal/tokenization_utils.html#transformers.PreTrainedTokenizerBase.__call__) for
  details.

  [What are input IDs?](../glossary.html#input-ids)
- **attention_mask** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, _optional_) --
  Mask to avoid performing attention on padding token indices. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:

  - 1 for tokens that are **not masked**,
  - 0 for tokens that are **masked**.

  [What are attention masks?](../glossary.html#attention-mask)

## ReformerModelWithLMHead

<a id='transformers.ReformerModelWithLMHead'></a>
> **class transformers.ReformerModelWithLMHead**(config)

Reformer Model with a _language modeling_ head on top. 
Reformer was proposed in [Reformer: The Efficient Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04451) by Nikita
Kitaev, ≈Åukasz Kaiser, Anselm Levskaya.

This model inherits from [PreTrainedModel](main_classes/model.html#transformers.PreTrainedModel). Check the superclass documentation for the generic
methods the library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input embeddings,
pruning heads etc.)

This model is also a PyTorch [torch.nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module)
subclass. Use it as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to
general usage and behavior.

> Parameters

- **config** ([ReformerConfig](model_doc/reformer.html#transformers.ReformerConfig)) -- Model configuration class with all the parameters of the model.
  Initializing with a config file does not load the weights associated with the model, only the
  configuration. Check out the [from_pretrained()](main_classes/model.html#transformers.PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained) method to load the model
  weights.


<a id='transformers.ReformerModelWithLMHead.forward'></a>

## ReformerForQuestionAnswering

<a id='transformers.ReformerForQuestionAnswering'></a>
> **class transformers.ReformerForQuestionAnswering**(config)


Reformer Model with a span classification head on top for extractive question-answering tasks like SQuAD / TriviaQA
( a linear layer on top of hidden-states output to compute _span start logits_ and _span end logits_.

Reformer was proposed in [Reformer: The Efficient Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04451) by Nikita
Kitaev, ≈Åukasz Kaiser, Anselm Levskaya.

This model inherits from [PreTrainedModel](main_classes/model.html#transformers.PreTrainedModel). Check the superclass documentation for the generic
methods the library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input embeddings,
pruning heads etc.)

This model is also a PyTorch [torch.nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module)
subclass. Use it as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to
general usage and behavior.

> Parameters

- **config** ([ReformerConfig](model_doc/reformer.html#transformers.ReformerConfig)) -- Model configuration class with all the parameters of the model.
  Initializing with a config file does not load the weights associated with the model, only the
  configuration. Check out the [from_pretrained()](main_classes/model.html#transformers.PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained) method to load the model
  weights.


<a id='transformers.ReformerForQuestionAnswering.forward'></a>
> **forward**(self, input_ids = None, position_ids = None, attention_mask = None, head_mask = None, inputs_embeds = None, num_hashes = None, start_positions = None, end_positions = None, output_hidden_states = None, output_attentions = None, return_dict = None)

The [ReformerForQuestionAnswering](model_doc/reformer.html#transformers.ReformerForQuestionAnswering) forward method, overrides the `__call__` special method.

<Tip>

Although the recipe for forward pass needs to be defined within this function, one should call the
`Module` instance afterwards instead of this since the former takes care of running the pre and post
processing steps while the latter silently ignores them.

</Tip>

> Parameters

- **input_ids** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`) --
  Indices of input sequence tokens in the vocabulary. During training the input_ids sequence_length has to be
  a multiple of the relevant model's chunk lengths (lsh's, local's or both). During evaluation, the indices
  are automatically padded to be a multiple of the chunk length.

  Indices can be obtained using [ReformerTokenizer](model_doc/reformer.html#transformers.ReformerTokenizer). See
  [transformers.PreTrainedTokenizer.encode()](internal/tokenization_utils.html#transformers.PreTrainedTokenizerBase.encode) and [transformers.PreTrainedTokenizer.__call__()](internal/tokenization_utils.html#transformers.PreTrainedTokenizerBase.__call__) for
  details.

  [What are input IDs?](../glossary.html#input-ids)
- **attention_mask** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, _optional_) --
  Mask to avoid performing attention on padding token indices. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:

  - 1 for tokens that are **not masked**,
  - 0 for tokens that are **masked**.

  [What are attention masks?](../glossary.html#attention-mask)
- **position_ids** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, _optional_) --
  Indices of positions of each input sequence tokens in the position embeddings. Selected in the range `[0, config.max_position_embeddings - 1]`.

  [What are position IDs?](../glossary.html#position-ids)
- **head_mask** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(num_heads,)` or `(num_layers, num_heads)`, _optional_) --
  Mask to nullify selected heads of the self-attention modules. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:

  - 1 indicates the head is **not masked**,
  - 0 indicates the head is **masked**.

- **inputs_embeds** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`, _optional_) --
  Optionally, instead of passing `input_ids` you can choose to directly pass an embedded representation.
  This is useful if you want more control over how to convert `input_ids` indices into associated
  vectors than the model's internal embedding lookup matrix.
- **num_hashes** (`int`, _optional_) --
  The number of hashing rounds that should be performed during bucketing. Setting this argument overwrites
  the default defined in `config.num_hashes`.

  For more information, see `num_hashes` in [ReformerConfig](model_doc/reformer.html#transformers.ReformerConfig).
- **past_buckets_states** (`List[Tuple(torch.LongTensor, torch.FloatTensor)]`, _optional_) --
  List of `Tuple(torch.LongTensor, torch.FloatTensor` of length `config.n_layers`, with the first
  element being the previous _buckets_ of shape `(batch_size, num_heads, num_hashes, sequence_length)`)
  and the second being the previous _hidden_states_ of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`).

  Contains precomputed hidden-states and buckets (only relevant for LSH Self-Attention). Can be used to speed
  up sequential decoding.
- **use_cache** (`bool`, _optional_) --
  If set to `True`, `past_key_values` key value states are returned and can be used to speed up
  decoding (see `past_key_values`).
- **output_attentions** (`bool`, _optional_) --
  Whether or not to return the attentions tensors of all attention layers. See `attentions` under returned
  tensors for more detail.
- **output_hidden_states** (`bool`, _optional_) --
  Whether or not to return the hidden states of all layers. See `hidden_states` under returned tensors for
  more detail.
- **return_dict** (`bool`, _optional_) --
  Whether or not to return a [ModelOutput](main_classes/output.html#transformers.file_utils.ModelOutput) instead of a plain tuple.

- **start_positions** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size,)`, _optional_) --
  Labels for position (index) of the start of the labelled span for computing the token classification loss.
  Positions are clamped to the length of the sequence (`sequence_length`). Position outside of the
  sequence are not taken into account for computing the loss.
- **end_positions** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size,)`, _optional_) --
  Labels for position (index) of the end of the labelled span for computing the token classification loss.
  Positions are clamped to the length of the sequence (`sequence_length`). Position outside of the
  sequence are not taken into account for computing the loss.

> Returns

A [QuestionAnsweringModelOutput](main_classes/output.html#transformers.modeling_outputs.QuestionAnsweringModelOutput) or a tuple of
`torch.FloatTensor` (if `return_dict=False` is passed or when `config.return_dict=False`) comprising
various elements depending on the configuration ([ReformerConfig](model_doc/reformer.html#transformers.ReformerConfig)) and inputs.

- **loss** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(1,)`, _optional_, returned when `labels` is provided) -- Total span extraction loss is the sum of a Cross-Entropy for the start and end positions.
- **start_logits** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`) -- Span-start scores (before SoftMax).
- **end_logits** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`) -- Span-end scores (before SoftMax).
- **hidden_states** (`tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`, _optional_, returned when `output_hidden_states=True` is passed or when `config.output_hidden_states=True`) -- Tuple of `torch.FloatTensor` (one for the output of the embeddings + one for the output of each layer)
  of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`.

  Hidden-states of the model at the output of each layer plus the initial embedding outputs.
- **attentions** (`tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`, _optional_, returned when `output_attentions=True` is passed or when `config.output_attentions=True`) -- Tuple of `torch.FloatTensor` (one for each layer) of shape `(batch_size, num_heads, sequence_length, sequence_length)`.

  Attentions weights after the attention softmax, used to compute the weighted average in the self-attention
  heads.
