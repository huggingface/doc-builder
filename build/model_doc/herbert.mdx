# HerBERT

## Overview

The HerBERT model was proposed in [KLEJ: Comprehensive Benchmark for Polish Language Understanding](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-main.111.pdf) by Piotr Rybak, Robert Mroczkowski, Janusz Tracz, and
Ireneusz Gawlik. It is a BERT-based Language Model trained on Polish Corpora using only MLM objective with dynamic
masking of whole words.

The abstract from the paper is the following:

*In recent years, a series of Transformer-based models unlocked major improvements in general natural language
understanding (NLU) tasks. Such a fast pace of research would not be possible without general NLU benchmarks, which
allow for a fair comparison of the proposed methods. However, such benchmarks are available only for a handful of
languages. To alleviate this issue, we introduce a comprehensive multi-task benchmark for the Polish language
understanding, accompanied by an online leaderboard. It consists of a diverse set of tasks, adopted from existing
datasets for named entity recognition, question-answering, textual entailment, and others. We also introduce a new
sentiment analysis task for the e-commerce domain, named Allegro Reviews (AR). To ensure a common evaluation scheme and
promote models that generalize to different NLU tasks, the benchmark includes datasets from varying domains and
applications. Additionally, we release HerBERT, a Transformer-based model trained specifically for the Polish language,
which has the best average performance and obtains the best results for three out of nine tasks. Finally, we provide an
extensive evaluation, including several standard baselines and recently proposed, multilingual Transformer-based
models.*

Examples of use:

```
>>> from transformers import HerbertTokenizer, RobertaModel

>>> tokenizer = HerbertTokenizer.from_pretrained("allegro/herbert-klej-cased-tokenizer-v1")
>>> model = RobertaModel.from_pretrained("allegro/herbert-klej-cased-v1")

>>> encoded_input = tokenizer.encode("Kto ma lepszą sztukę, ma lepszy rząd – to jasne.", return_tensors='pt')
>>> outputs = model(encoded_input)

>>> # HerBERT can also be loaded using AutoTokenizer and AutoModel:
>>> import torch
>>> from transformers import AutoModel, AutoTokenizer

>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("allegro/herbert-klej-cased-tokenizer-v1")
>>> model = AutoModel.from_pretrained("allegro/herbert-klej-cased-v1")
```

This model was contributed by [rmroczkowski](https://huggingface.co/rmroczkowski). The original code can be found

## HerbertTokenizer

<a id='transformers.HerbertTokenizer'></a>
> **class transformers.HerbertTokenizer**(vocab_file, merges_file, tokenizer_file = None, cls_token = <s>, unk_token = <unk>, pad_token = <pad>, mask_token = <mask>, sep_token = </s>, do_lowercase_and_remove_accent = False, **kwargs)


Construct a BPE tokenizer for HerBERT.

Peculiarities:

- uses BERT's pre-tokenizer: BaseTokenizer splits tokens on spaces, and also on punctuation. Each occurrence of a
  punctuation character will be treated separately.

- Such pretokenized input is BPE subtokenized

This tokenizer inherits from [XLMTokenizer](model_doc/xlm.html#transformers.XLMTokenizer) which contains most of the methods. Users should
refer to the superclass for more information regarding methods.


## HerbertTokenizerFast

<a id='transformers.HerbertTokenizerFast'></a>
> **class transformers.HerbertTokenizerFast**(vocab_file = None, merges_file = None, tokenizer_file = None, cls_token = <s>, unk_token = <unk>, pad_token = <pad>, mask_token = <mask>, sep_token = </s>, **kwargs)


Construct a "Fast" BPE tokenizer for HerBERT (backed by HuggingFace's _tokenizers_ library).

Peculiarities:

- uses BERT's pre-tokenizer: BertPreTokenizer splits tokens on spaces, and also on punctuation. Each occurrence of
  a punctuation character will be treated separately.

This tokenizer inherits from [PreTrainedTokenizer](main_classes/tokenizer.html#transformers.PreTrainedTokenizer) which contains most of the methods. Users
should refer to the superclass for more information regarding methods.

> Parameters

- **vocab_file** (`str`) --
  Path to the vocabulary file.
- **merges_file** (`str`) --
  Path to the merges file.


<a id='transformers.HerbertTokenizerFast.build_inputs_with_special_tokens'></a>
> **build\_inputs\_with\_special\_tokens**(self, token_ids_0: typing.List[int], token_ids_1: typing.Optional[typing.List[int]] = None)


Build model inputs from a sequence or a pair of sequence for sequence classification tasks by concatenating and
adding special tokens. An HerBERT, like BERT sequence has the following format:

- single sequence: `<s> X </s>`
- pair of sequences: `<s> A </s> B &amp;lt;/s>`

> Parameters

- **token_ids_0** (`List[int]`) --
  List of IDs to which the special tokens will be added.
- **token_ids_1** (`List[int]`, _optional_) --
  Optional second list of IDs for sequence pairs.

> Returns

List of [input IDs](../glossary.html#input-ids) with the appropriate special tokens.

> Return type

`List[int]`


<a id='transformers.HerbertTokenizerFast.create_token_type_ids_from_sequences'></a>
> **create\_token\_type\_ids\_from\_sequences**(self, token_ids_0: typing.List[int], token_ids_1: typing.Optional[typing.List[int]] = None)


Create a mask from the two sequences passed to be used in a sequence-pair classification task. HerBERT, like
BERT sequence pair mask has the following format:

```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
| first sequence    | second sequence |
```

> Parameters

- **token_ids_0** (`List[int]`) --
  List of IDs.
- **token_ids_1** (`List[int]`, _optional_) --
  Optional second list of IDs for sequence pairs.

> Returns

List of [token type IDs](../glossary.html#token-type-ids) according to the given
sequence(s).

> Return type

`List[int]`


<a id='transformers.HerbertTokenizerFast.get_special_tokens_mask'></a>
> **get\_special\_tokens\_mask**(self, token_ids_0: typing.List[int], token_ids_1: typing.Optional[typing.List[int]] = None, already_has_special_tokens: bool = False)


Retrieve sequence ids from a token list that has no special tokens added. This method is called when adding
special tokens using the tokenizer `prepare_for_model` method.

> Parameters

- **token_ids_0** (`List[int]`) --
  List of IDs.
- **token_ids_1** (`List[int]`, _optional_) --
  Optional second list of IDs for sequence pairs.
- **already_has_special_tokens** (`bool`, _optional_, defaults to `False`) --
  Whether or not the token list is already formatted with special tokens for the model.

> Returns

A list of integers in the range [0, 1]: 1 for a special token, 0 for a sequence token.

> Return type

`List[int]`
