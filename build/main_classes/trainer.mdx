# Trainer

The [Trainer](/docs/transformers/master/en/main_classes/trainer.html#transformers.Trainer) and [TFTrainer](/docs/transformers/master/en/main_classes/trainer.html#transformers.TFTrainer) classes provide an API for feature-complete
training in most standard use cases. It's used in most of the [example scripts](/docs/transformers/master/en/../examples.html).

Before instantiating your [Trainer](/docs/transformers/master/en/main_classes/trainer.html#transformers.Trainer)/[TFTrainer](/docs/transformers/master/en/main_classes/trainer.html#transformers.TFTrainer), create a
[TrainingArguments](/docs/transformers/master/en/main_classes/trainer.html#transformers.TrainingArguments)/[TFTrainingArguments](/docs/transformers/master/en/main_classes/trainer.html#transformers.TFTrainingArguments) to access all the points of
customization during training.

The API supports distributed training on multiple GPUs/TPUs, mixed precision through [NVIDIA Apex](https://github.com/NVIDIA/apex) and Native AMP for PyTorch and `tf.keras.mixed_precision` for TensorFlow.

Both [Trainer](/docs/transformers/master/en/main_classes/trainer.html#transformers.Trainer) and [TFTrainer](/docs/transformers/master/en/main_classes/trainer.html#transformers.TFTrainer) contain the basic training loop which supports
the above features. To inject custom behavior you can subclass them and override the following methods:

- **get_train_dataloader**/**get_train_tfdataset** -- Creates the training DataLoader (PyTorch) or TF Dataset.
- **get_eval_dataloader**/**get_eval_tfdataset** -- Creates the evaluation DataLoader (PyTorch) or TF Dataset.
- **get_test_dataloader**/**get_test_tfdataset** -- Creates the test DataLoader (PyTorch) or TF Dataset.
- **log** -- Logs information on the various objects watching training.
- **create_optimizer_and_scheduler** -- Sets up the optimizer and learning rate scheduler if they were not passed at
  init. Note, that you can also subclass or override the `create_optimizer` and `create_scheduler` methods
  separately.
- **create_optimizer** -- Sets up the optimizer if it wasn't passed at init.
- **create_scheduler** -- Sets up the learning rate scheduler if it wasn't passed at init.
- **compute_loss** - Computes the loss on a batch of training inputs.
- **training_step** -- Performs a training step.
- **prediction_step** -- Performs an evaluation/test step.
- **run_model** (TensorFlow only) -- Basic pass through the model.
- **evaluate** -- Runs an evaluation loop and returns metrics.
- **predict** -- Returns predictions (with metrics if labels are available) on a test set.

<Tip warning={true}>

The [Trainer](/docs/transformers/master/en/main_classes/trainer.html#transformers.Trainer) class is optimized for ðŸ¤— Transformers models and can have surprising behaviors
when you use it on other models. When using it on your own model, make sure:

- your model always return tuples or subclasses of [ModelOutput](/docs/transformers/master/en/main_classes/output.html#transformers.file_utils.ModelOutput).
- your model can compute the loss if a `labels` argument is provided and that loss is returned as the first
  element of the tuple (if your model returns tuples)
- your model can accept multiple label arguments (use the `label_names` in your
  [TrainingArguments](/docs/transformers/master/en/main_classes/trainer.html#transformers.TrainingArguments) to indicate their name to the [Trainer](/docs/transformers/master/en/main_classes/trainer.html#transformers.Trainer)) but none
  of them should be named `"label"`.

</Tip>

Here is an example of how to customize [Trainer](/docs/transformers/master/en/main_classes/trainer.html#transformers.Trainer) using a custom loss function for multi-label
classification:

```python
from torch import nn
from transformers import Trainer

class MultilabelTrainer(Trainer):
def compute_loss(self, model, inputs, return_outputs=False):
labels = inputs.get("labels")
outputs = model(**inputs)
logits = outputs.get('logits')
loss_fct = nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss()
loss = loss_fct(logits.view(-1, self.model.config.num_labels),
labels.float().view(-1, self.model.config.num_labels))
return (loss, outputs) if return_outputs else loss
```

Another way to customize the training loop behavior for the PyTorch [Trainer](/docs/transformers/master/en/main_classes/trainer.html#transformers.Trainer) is to use
[callbacks](/docs/transformers/master/en/callback.html) that can inspect the training loop state (for progress reporting, logging on TensorBoard or
other ML platforms...) and take decisions (like early stopping).


## Trainer

<a id='transformers.Trainer'></a>
> **class transformers.Trainer**(model: typing.Union[transformers.modeling_utils.PreTrainedModel, torch.nn.modules.module.Module] = None, args: TrainingArguments = None, data_collator: typing.Optional[DataCollator] = None, train_dataset: typing.Optional[torch.utils.data.dataset.Dataset] = None, eval_dataset: typing.Optional[torch.utils.data.dataset.Dataset] = None, tokenizer: typing.Optional[transformers.tokenization_utils_base.PreTrainedTokenizerBase] = None, model_init: typing.Callable[[], transformers.modeling_utils.PreTrainedModel] = None, compute_metrics: typing.Union[typing.Callable[[transformers.trainer_utils.EvalPrediction], typing.Dict], NoneType] = None, callbacks: typing.Optional[typing.List[transformers.trainer_callback.TrainerCallback]] = None, optimizers: typing.Tuple[torch.optim.optimizer.Optimizer, torch.optim.lr_scheduler.LambdaLR] = (None, None))


Trainer is a simple but feature-complete training and eval loop for PyTorch, optimized for ðŸ¤— Transformers.

> Parameters

- **model** ([PreTrainedModel](/docs/transformers/master/en/main_classes/model.html#transformers.PreTrainedModel) or `torch.nn.Module`, _optional_) --
  The model to train, evaluate or use for predictions. If not provided, a `model_init` must be passed.

<Tip>

[Trainer](/docs/transformers/master/en/main_classes/trainer.html#transformers.Trainer) is optimized to work with the [PreTrainedModel](/docs/transformers/master/en/main_classes/model.html#transformers.PreTrainedModel)
provided by the library. You can still use your own models defined as `torch.nn.Module` as long as
they work the same way as the ðŸ¤— Transformers models.

</Tip>

- **args** ([TrainingArguments](/docs/transformers/master/en/main_classes/trainer.html#transformers.TrainingArguments), _optional_) --
  The arguments to tweak for training. Will default to a basic instance of
  [TrainingArguments](/docs/transformers/master/en/main_classes/trainer.html#transformers.TrainingArguments) with the `output_dir` set to a directory named _tmp_trainer_ in
  the current directory if not provided.
- **data_collator** (`DataCollator`, _optional_) --
  The function to use to form a batch from a list of elements of `train_dataset` or `eval_dataset`.
  Will default to [default_data_collator()](/docs/transformers/master/en/main_classes/data_collator.html#transformers.default_data_collator) if no `tokenizer` is provided, an instance of
  [DataCollatorWithPadding](/docs/transformers/master/en/main_classes/data_collator.html#transformers.DataCollatorWithPadding) otherwise.
- **train_dataset** (`torch.utils.data.Dataset` or `torch.utils.data.IterableDataset`, _optional_) --
  The dataset to use for training. If it is an `datasets.Dataset`, columns not accepted by the
  `model.forward()` method are automatically removed.

  Note that if it's a `torch.utils.data.IterableDataset` with some randomization and you are training in
  a distributed fashion, your iterable dataset should either use a internal attribute `generator` that
  is a `torch.Generator` for the randomization that must be identical on all processes (and the Trainer
  will manually set the seed of this `generator` at each epoch) or have a `set_epoch()` method that
  internally sets the seed of the RNGs used.
- **eval_dataset** (`torch.utils.data.Dataset`, _optional_) --
  The dataset to use for evaluation. If it is an `datasets.Dataset`, columns not accepted by the
  `model.forward()` method are automatically removed.
- **tokenizer** ([PreTrainedTokenizerBase](/docs/transformers/master/en/internal/tokenization_utils.html#transformers.PreTrainedTokenizerBase), _optional_) --
  The tokenizer used to preprocess the data. If provided, will be used to automatically pad the inputs the
  maximum length when batching inputs, and it will be saved along the model to make it easier to rerun an
  interrupted training or reuse the fine-tuned model.
- **model_init** (`Callable[[], PreTrainedModel]`, _optional_) --
  A function that instantiates the model to be used. If provided, each call to
  [train()](/docs/transformers/master/en/main_classes/trainer.html#transformers.Trainer.train) will start from a new instance of the model as given by this function.

  The function may have zero argument, or a single one containing the optuna/Ray Tune/SigOpt trial object, to
  be able to choose different architectures according to hyper parameters (such as layer count, sizes of
  inner layers, dropout probabilities etc).
- **compute_metrics** (`Callable[[EvalPrediction], Dict]`, _optional_) --
  The function that will be used to compute metrics at evaluation. Must take a
  [EvalPrediction](/docs/transformers/master/en/internal/trainer_utils.html#transformers.EvalPrediction) and return a dictionary string to metric values.
- **callbacks** (List of `~transformers.TrainerCallback`, _optional_) --
  A list of callbacks to customize the training loop. Will add those to the list of default callbacks
  detailed in [here](/docs/transformers/master/en/callback.html).

  If you want to remove one of the default callbacks used, use the [Trainer.remove_callback()](/docs/transformers/master/en/main_classes/trainer.html#transformers.Trainer.remove_callback) method.
- **optimizers** (`Tuple[torch.optim.Optimizer, torch.optim.lr_scheduler.LambdaLR`, _optional_) -- A tuple
  containing the optimizer and the scheduler to use. Will default to an instance of
  [AdamW](/docs/transformers/master/en/main_classes/optimizer_schedules.html#transformers.AdamW) on your model and a scheduler given by
  [get_linear_schedule_with_warmup()](/docs/transformers/master/en/main_classes/optimizer_schedules.html#transformers.get_linear_schedule_with_warmup) controlled by `args`.

  Important attributes:

  - **model** -- Always points to the core model. If using a transformers model, it will be a
    [PreTrainedModel](/docs/transformers/master/en/main_classes/model.html#transformers.PreTrainedModel) subclass.
  - **model_wrapped** -- Always points to the most external model in case one or more other modules wrap the
    original model. This is the model that should be used for the forward pass. For example, under `DeepSpeed`,
    the inner model is wrapped in `DeepSpeed` and then again in `torch.nn.DistributedDataParallel`. If the
    inner model hasn't been wrapped, then `self.model_wrapped` is the same as `self.model`.
  - **is_model_parallel** -- Whether or not a model has been switched to a model parallel mode (different from
    data parallelism, this means some of the model layers are split on different GPUs).
  - **place_model_on_device** -- Whether or not to automatically place the model on the device - it will be set
    to `False` if model parallel or deepspeed is used, or if the default
    `TrainingArguments.place_model_on_device` is overridden to return `False` .
  - **is_in_train** -- Whether or not a model is currently running `train` (e.g. when `evaluate` is called
    while in `train`)



<a id='transformers.Trainer.add_callback'></a>
> **add\_callback**(self, callback)


Add a callback to the current list of `TrainerCallback`.

> Parameters

- **callback** (`type` or `TrainerCallback`) --
  A `TrainerCallback` class or an instance of a `TrainerCallback`.
  In the first case, will instantiate a member of that class.


<a id='transformers.Trainer.compute_loss'></a>
> **compute\_loss**(self, model, inputs, return_outputs = False)


How the loss is computed by Trainer. By default, all models return the loss in the first element.

Subclass and override for custom behavior.


<a id='transformers.Trainer.create_optimizer'></a>
> **create\_optimizer**(self)


Setup the optimizer.

We provide a reasonable default that works well. If you want to use something else, you can pass a tuple in the
Trainer's init through `optimizers`, or subclass and override this method in a subclass.


<a id='transformers.Trainer.create_optimizer_and_scheduler'></a>
> **create\_optimizer\_and\_scheduler**(self, num_training_steps: int)


Setup the optimizer and the learning rate scheduler.

We provide a reasonable default that works well. If you want to use something else, you can pass a tuple in the
Trainer's init through `optimizers`, or subclass and override this method (or `create_optimizer`
and/or `create_scheduler`) in a subclass.


<a id='transformers.Trainer.create_scheduler'></a>
> **create\_scheduler**(self, num_training_steps: int, optimizer: Optimizer = None)


Setup the scheduler. The optimizer of the trainer must have been set up either before this method is called or
passed as an argument.

> Parameters

- **num_training_steps** (int) -- The number of training steps to do.


<a id='transformers.Trainer.evaluate'></a>
> **evaluate**(self, eval_dataset: typing.Optional[torch.utils.data.dataset.Dataset] = None, ignore_keys: typing.Optional[typing.List[str]] = None, metric_key_prefix: str = eval)


Run evaluation and returns metrics.

The calling script will be responsible for providing a method to compute metrics, as they are task-dependent
(pass it to the init `compute_metrics` argument).

You can also subclass and override this method to inject custom behavior.

> Parameters

- **eval_dataset** (`Dataset`, _optional_) --
  Pass a dataset if you wish to override `self.eval_dataset`. If it is an `datasets.Dataset`,
  columns not accepted by the `model.forward()` method are automatically removed. It must implement the
  `__len__` method.
- **ignore_keys** (`Lst[str]`, _optional_) --
  A list of keys in the output of your model (if it is a dictionary) that should be ignored when
  gathering predictions.
- **metric_key_prefix** (`str`, _optional_, defaults to `"eval"`) --
  An optional prefix to be used as the metrics key prefix. For example the metrics "bleu" will be named
  "eval_bleu" if the prefix is "eval" (default)

> Returns

A dictionary containing the evaluation loss and the potential metrics computed from the predictions. The
dictionary also contains the epoch number which comes from the training state.


<a id='transformers.Trainer.evaluation_loop'></a>
> **evaluation\_loop**(self, dataloader: DataLoader, description: str, prediction_loss_only: typing.Optional[bool] = None, ignore_keys: typing.Optional[typing.List[str]] = None, metric_key_prefix: str = eval)


Prediction/evaluation loop, shared by `Trainer.evaluate()` and `Trainer.predict()`.

Works both with or without labels.


<a id='transformers.Trainer.floating_point_ops'></a>
> **floating\_point\_ops**(self, inputs: typing.Dict[str, typing.Union[torch.Tensor, typing.Any]])


For models that inherit from [PreTrainedModel](/docs/transformers/master/en/main_classes/model.html#transformers.PreTrainedModel), uses that method to compute the number of
floating point operations for every backward + forward pass. If using another model, either implement such a
method in the model or subclass and override this method.

> Parameters

- **inputs** (`Dict[str, Union[torch.Tensor, Any]]`) --
  The inputs and targets of the model.

> Returns

The number of floating-point operations.

> Return type

`int`


<a id='transformers.Trainer.get_eval_dataloader'></a>
> **get\_eval\_dataloader**(self, eval_dataset: typing.Optional[torch.utils.data.dataset.Dataset] = None)


Returns the evaluation `DataLoader`.

Subclass and override this method if you want to inject some custom behavior.

> Parameters

- **eval_dataset** (`torch.utils.data.Dataset`, _optional_) --
  If provided, will override `self.eval_dataset`. If it is an `datasets.Dataset`, columns not
  accepted by the `model.forward()` method are automatically removed. It must implement `__len__`.


<a id='transformers.Trainer.get_test_dataloader'></a>
> **get\_test\_dataloader**(self, test_dataset: Dataset)


Returns the test `DataLoader`.

Subclass and override this method if you want to inject some custom behavior.

> Parameters

- **test_dataset** (`torch.utils.data.Dataset`, _optional_) --
  The test dataset to use. If it is an `datasets.Dataset`, columns not accepted by the
  `model.forward()` method are automatically removed. It must implement `__len__`.


<a id='transformers.Trainer.get_train_dataloader'></a>
> **get\_train\_dataloader**(self)


Returns the training `DataLoader`.

Will use no sampler if `self.train_dataset` does not implement `__len__`, a random sampler (adapted
to distributed training if necessary) otherwise.

Subclass and override this method if you want to inject some custom behavior.


<a id='transformers.Trainer.hyperparameter_search'></a>
> **hyperparameter\_search**(self, hp_space: typing.Union[typing.Callable[[ForwardRef('optuna.Trial')], typing.Dict[str, float]], NoneType] = None, compute_objective: typing.Union[typing.Callable[[typing.Dict[str, float]], float], NoneType] = None, n_trials: int = 20, direction: str = minimize, backend: typing.Union[ForwardRef('str'), transformers.trainer_utils.HPSearchBackend, NoneType] = None, hp_name: typing.Union[typing.Callable[[ForwardRef('optuna.Trial')], str], NoneType] = None, **kwargs)


Launch an hyperparameter search using `optuna` or `Ray Tune` or `SigOpt`. The optimized quantity is
determined by `compute_objective`, which defaults to a function returning the evaluation loss when no
metric is provided, the sum of all metrics otherwise.

<Tip warning={true}>

To use this method, you need to have provided a `model_init` when initializing your
[Trainer](/docs/transformers/master/en/main_classes/trainer.html#transformers.Trainer): we need to reinitialize the model at each new run. This is incompatible
with the `optimizers` argument, so you need to subclass [Trainer](/docs/transformers/master/en/main_classes/trainer.html#transformers.Trainer) and override the
method [create_optimizer_and_scheduler()](/docs/transformers/master/en/main_classes/trainer.html#transformers.Trainer.create_optimizer_and_scheduler) for custom optimizer/scheduler.

</Tip>

> Parameters

- **hp_space** (`Callable[["optuna.Trial"], Dict[str, float]]`, _optional_) --
  A function that defines the hyperparameter search space. Will default to
  `default_hp_space_optuna()` or
  `default_hp_space_ray()` or
  `default_hp_space_sigopt()` depending on your backend.
- **compute_objective** (`Callable[[Dict[str, float]], float]`, _optional_) --
  A function computing the objective to minimize or maximize from the metrics returned by the
  `evaluate` method. Will default to `default_compute_objective()`.
- **n_trials** (`int`, _optional_, defaults to 100) --
  The number of trial runs to test.
- **direction(`str`,** _optional_, defaults to `"minimize"`) --
  Whether to optimize greater or lower objects. Can be `"minimize"` or `"maximize"`, you should
  pick `"minimize"` when optimizing the validation loss, `"maximize"` when optimizing one or
  several metrics.
- **backend(`str`** or `HPSearchBackend`, _optional_) --
  The backend to use for hyperparameter search. Will default to optuna or Ray Tune or SigOpt, depending
  on which one is installed. If all are installed, will default to optuna.
  kwargs --
  Additional keyword arguments passed along to `optuna.create_study` or `ray.tune.run`. For
  more information see:

  - the documentation of [optuna.create_study](https://optuna.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/generated/optuna.study.create_study.html)
  - the documentation of [tune.run](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/tune/api_docs/execution.html#tune-run)

machines) main process.


<a id='transformers.Trainer.is_world_process_zero'></a>
> **is\_world\_process\_zero**(self)


Whether or not this process is the global main process (when training in a distributed fashion on several
machines, this is only going to be `True` for one process).


<a id='transformers.Trainer.log'></a>
> **log**(self, logs: typing.Dict[str, float])


Log `logs` on the various objects watching training.

Subclass and override this method to inject custom behavior.

  The values to log.


<a id='transformers.trainer_pt_utils.log_metrics'></a>
> **log\_metrics**(self, split, metrics)


Log metrics in a specially formatted way

Under distributed environment this is done only for a process with rank 0.

  Mode/split name: one of `train`, `eval`, `test`
- **metrics** (`Dict[str, float]`) --
  The metrics returned from train/evaluate/predictmetrics: metrics dict

  Notes on memory reports:

  In order to get memory usage report you need to install `psutil`. You can do that with `pip install psutil`.

> Now when this method is run, you will see a report that will include: :

```python
init_mem_cpu_alloc_delta   =     1301MB
init_mem_cpu_peaked_delta  =      154MB
init_mem_gpu_alloc_delta   =      230MB
init_mem_gpu_peaked_delta  =        0MB
train_mem_cpu_alloc_delta  =     1345MB
train_mem_cpu_peaked_delta =        0MB
train_mem_gpu_alloc_delta  =      693MB
train_mem_gpu_peaked_delta =        7MB
```

**Understanding the reports:**

- the first segment, e.g., `train__`, tells you which stage the metrics are for. Reports starting with `init_`
  will be added to the first stage that gets run. So that if only evaluation is run, the memory usage for the
  `__init__` will be reported along with the `eval_` metrics.
- the third segment, is either `cpu` or `gpu`, tells you whether it's the general RAM or the gpu0 memory
  metric.
- `*_alloc_delta` - is the difference in the used/allocated memory counter between the end and the start of the
  stage - it can be negative if a function released more memory than it allocated.
- `*_peaked_delta` - is any extra memory that was consumed and then freed - relative to the current allocated
  memory counter - it is never negative. When you look at the metrics of any stage you add up `alloc_delta` +
  `peaked_delta` and you know how much memory was needed to complete that stage.

The reporting happens only for process of rank 0 and gpu 0 (if there is a gpu). Typically this is enough since the
main process does the bulk of work, but it could be not quite so if model parallel is used and then other GPUs may
use a different amount of gpu memory. This is also not the same under DataParallel where gpu0 may require much more
memory than the rest since it stores the gradient and optimizer states for all participating GPUS. Perhaps in the
future these reports will evolve to measure those too.

The CPU RAM metric measures RSS (Resident Set Size) includes both the memory which is unique to the process and the
memory shared with other processes. It is important to note that it does not include swapped out memory, so the
reports could be imprecise.

The CPU peak memory is measured using a sampling thread. Due to python's GIL it may miss some of the peak memory if
that thread didn't get a chance to run when the highest memory was used. Therefore this report can be less than
reality. Using `tracemalloc` would have reported the exact peak memory, but it doesn't report memory allocations
outside of python. So if some C++ CUDA extension allocated its own memory it won't be reported. And therefore it
was dropped in favor of the memory sampling approach, which reads the current process memory usage.

The GPU allocated and peak memory reporting is done with `torch.cuda.memory_allocated()` and
`torch.cuda.max_memory_allocated()`. This metric reports only "deltas" for pytorch-specific allocations, as
`torch.cuda` memory management system doesn't track any memory allocated outside of pytorch. For example, the
very first cuda call typically loads CUDA kernels, which may take from 0.5 to 2GB of GPU memory.

Note that this tracker doesn't account for memory allocations outside of [Trainer](/docs/transformers/master/en/main_classes/trainer.html#transformers.Trainer)'s
`__init__`, `train`, `evaluate` and `predict` calls.

Because `evaluation` calls may happen during `train`, we can't handle nested invocations because
`torch.cuda.max_memory_allocated` is a single counter, so if it gets reset by a nested eval call, `train`'s
tracker will report incorrect info. If this [pytorch issue](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/16266)
gets resolved it will be possible to change this class to be re-entrant. Until then we will only track the outer
level of `train`, `evaluate` and `predict` methods. Which means that if `eval` is called during `train`,
it's the latter that will account for its memory usage and that of the former.

This also means that if any other tool that is used along the [Trainer](/docs/transformers/master/en/main_classes/trainer.html#transformers.Trainer) calls
`torch.cuda.reset_peak_memory_stats`, the gpu peak memory stats could be invalid. And the
[Trainer](/docs/transformers/master/en/main_classes/trainer.html#transformers.Trainer) will disrupt the normal behavior of any such tools that rely on calling
`torch.cuda.reset_peak_memory_stats` themselves.

For best performance you may want to consider turning the memory profiling off for production runs.


<a id='transformers.trainer_pt_utils.metrics_format'></a>
> **metrics\_format**(self, metrics: typing.Dict[str, float])


Reformat Trainer metrics values to a human-readable format

> Parameters

- **metrics** (`Dict[str, float]`) --
  The metrics returned from train/evaluate/predict

> Returns

The reformatted metrics

> Return type

metrics (`Dict[str, float]`)


<a id='transformers.Trainer.num_examples'></a>
> **num\_examples**(self, dataloader: DataLoader)


Helper to get number of samples in a `DataLoader` by accessing its dataset.

Will raise an exception if the underlying dataset does not implement method `__len__`


<a id='transformers.Trainer.pop_callback'></a>
> **pop\_callback**(self, callback)


Remove a callback from the current list of `TrainerCallback` and returns it.

If the callback is not found, returns `None` (and no error is raised).

> Parameters

- **callback** (`type` or `TrainerCallback`) --
  A `TrainerCallback` class or an instance of a `TrainerCallback`.
  In the first case, will pop the first member of that class found in the list of callbacks.

> Returns

The callback removed, if found.

> Return type

`TrainerCallback`


<a id='transformers.Trainer.predict'></a>
> **predict**(self, test_dataset: Dataset, ignore_keys: typing.Optional[typing.List[str]] = None, metric_key_prefix: str = test)


Run prediction and returns predictions and potential metrics.

Depending on the dataset and your use case, your test dataset may contain labels. In that case, this method
will also return metrics, like in `evaluate()`.

> Parameters

- **test_dataset** (`Dataset`) --
  Dataset to run the predictions on. If it is an `datasets.Dataset`, columns not accepted by the
  `model.forward()` method are automatically removed. Has to implement the method `__len__`
- **ignore_keys** (`Lst[str]`, _optional_) --
  A list of keys in the output of your model (if it is a dictionary) that should be ignored when
  gathering predictions.
- **metric_key_prefix** (`str`, _optional_, defaults to `"test"`) --
  An optional prefix to be used as the metrics key prefix. For example the metrics "bleu" will be named
  "test_bleu" if the prefix is "test" (default)

<Tip>

If your predictions or labels have different sequence length (for instance because you're doing dynamic
padding in a token classification task) the predictions will be padded (on the right) to allow for
concatenation into one array. The padding index is -100.

</Tip>

Returns: _NamedTuple_ A namedtuple with the following keys:

- predictions (`np.ndarray`): The predictions on `test_dataset`.
- label_ids (`np.ndarray`, _optional_): The labels (if the dataset contained some).
- metrics (`Dict[str, float]`, _optional_): The potential dictionary of metrics (if the dataset
  contained labels).


<a id='transformers.Trainer.prediction_loop'></a>

  on the [Apex documentation](https://nvidia.github.io/apex/amp.html).
- **fp16_backend** (`str`, _optional_, defaults to `"auto"`) --
  The backend to use for mixed precision training. Must be one of `"auto"`, `"amp"` or

  models. Must be the name of a metric returned by the evaluation with or without the prefix `"eval_"`.
  Will default to `"loss"` if unspecified and `load_best_model_at_end=True` (to use the evaluation

  Use Sharded DDP training from [FairScale](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairscale) (in distributed
  training only). This is an experimental feature.

  padding applied and be more efficient). Only useful if applying dynamic padding.
- **length_column_name** (`str`, _optional_, defaults to `"length"`) --
  Column name for precomputed lengths. If the column exists, grouping by length will use these values rather
  than computing them on train startup. Ignored unless `group_by_length` is `True` and the dataset
  is an instance of `Dataset`.
- **report_to** (`str` or `List[str]`, _optional_, defaults to `"all"`) --
  The list of integrations to report the results and logs to. Supported platforms are `"azure_ml"`,

  down the training and evaluation speed.
- **push_to_hub** (`bool`, _optional_, defaults to `False`) --
  Whether or not to upload the trained model to the hub after training. If this is activated, and
  `output_dir` exists, it needs to be a local clone of the repository to which the
  [Trainer](/docs/transformers/master/en/main_classes/trainer.html#transformers.Trainer) will be pushed.
- **resume_from_checkpoint** (`str`, _optional_) --
  The path to a folder with a valid checkpoint for your model. This argument is not directly used by
  [Trainer](/docs/transformers/master/en/main_classes/trainer.html#transformers.Trainer), it's intended to be used by your training/evaluation scripts instead. See
  the [example scripts](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/master/examples) for more
  details.
- **hub_model_id** (`str`, _optional_) --
  The name of the repository to keep in sync with the local _output_dir_. It can be a simple model ID in
  which case the model will be pushed in your namespace. Otherwise it should be the whole repository name,
  for instance `"user_name/model"`, which allows you to push to an organization you are a member of with
  `"organization_name/model"`. Will default to `user_name/output_dir_name` with _output_dir_name_
  being the name of `output_dir`.

  Will default to to the name of `output_dir`.

  - `"every_save"`: push the model, its configuration, the tokenizer (if passed along to the
    [Trainer](/docs/transformers/master/en/main_classes/trainer.html#transformers.Trainer)) and a draft of a model card each time there is a model save. The pushes
    are asynchronous to not block training, and in case the save are very frequent, a new push is only
    attempted if the previous one is finished. A last push is made with the final model at the end of
    training.
  - `"checkpoint"`: like `"every_save"` but the latest checkpoint is also pushed in a subfolder
    named last-checkpoint, allowing you to resume training easily with
    `trainer.train(resume_from_checkpoint="last-checkpoint")`.
  - `"all_checkpoints"`: like `"checkpoint"` but all checkpoints are pushed like they appear in the
    output folder (so you will get one checkpoint folder per folder in your final repository)

- **hub_token** (`str`, _optional_) --
  The token to use to push the model to the Hub. Will default to the token in the cache folder obtained with
  `huggingface-cli login`.
- **gradient_checkpointing** (`bool`, _optional_, defaults to `False`) --
  If True, use gradient checkpointing to save memory at the expense of slower backward pass.


<a id='transformers.TrainingArguments.get_process_log_level'></a>
> **get\_process\_log\_level**(self)


Returns the log level to be used depending on whether this process is the main process of node 0, main process
of node non-0, or a non-main process.

For the main process the log level defaults to `logging.INFO` unless overridden by `log_level` argument.

For the replica processes the log level defaults to `logging.WARNING` unless overridden by
`log_level_replica` argument.

The choice between the main and replica process settings is made according to the return value of
`should_log`.


<a id='transformers.TrainingArguments.get_warmup_steps'></a>
> **get\_warmup\_steps**(self, num_training_steps: int)


Get number of steps used for a linear warmup.


<a id='transformers.TrainingArguments.main_process_first'></a>
> **main\_process\_first**(self, local = True, desc = work)


A context manager for torch distributed environment where on needs to do something on the main process,
while blocking replicas, and when it's finished releasing the replicas.

One such use is for `datasets`'s `map` feature which to be efficient should be run once on the main
process, which upon completion saves a cached version of results and which then automatically gets loaded
by the replicas.

> Parameters

- **local** (`bool`, _optional_, defaults to `True`) --
  if `True` first means process of rank 0 of each node if `False` first means process of rank 0
  of node rank 0 In multi-node environment with a shared filesystem you most likely will want to use
  `local=False` so that only the main process of the first node will do the processing. If however, the
  filesystem is not shared, then the main process of each node will need to do the processing, which is
  the default behavior.
- **desc** (`str`, _optional_, defaults to `"work"`) --
  a work description to be used in debug logs



<a id='transformers.TrainingArguments.to_dict'></a>
> **to\_dict**(self)


Serializes this instance while replace _Enum_ by their values (for JSON serialization support). It obfuscates
the token values by removing their value.


<a id='transformers.TrainingArguments.to_json_string'></a>
> **to\_json\_string**(self)


Serializes this instance to a JSON string.


<a id='transformers.TrainingArguments.to_sanitized_dict'></a>

TrainingArguments is the subset of the arguments we use in our example scripts **which relate to the training loop
itself**.

Using [HfArgumentParser](/docs/transformers/master/en/internal/trainer_utils.html#transformers.HfArgumentParser) we can turn this class into [argparse](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html#module-argparse) arguments that can be specified on the command
line.

  padding applied and be more efficient). Only useful if applying dynamic padding.
- **length_column_name** (`str`, _optional_, defaults to `"length"`) --

  than computing them on train startup. Ignored unless `group_by_length` is `True` and the dataset
  is an instance of `Dataset`.
- **report_to** (`str` or `List[str]`, _optional_, defaults to `"all"`) --

    [Trainer](/docs/transformers/master/en/main_classes/trainer.html#transformers.Trainer)) and a draft of a model card each time there is a model save. The pushes
    are asynchronous to not block training, and in case the save are very frequent, a new push is only
    attempted if the previous one is finished. A last push is made with the final model at the end of
    training.

## Checkpoints

By default, [Trainer](/docs/transformers/master/en/main_classes/trainer.html#transformers.Trainer) will save all checkpoints in the `output_dir` you set in the
[TrainingArguments](/docs/transformers/master/en/main_classes/trainer.html#transformers.TrainingArguments) you are using. Those will go in subfolder named `checkpoint-xxx` with xxx
being the step at which the training was at.

Resuming training from a checkpoint can be done when calling [train()](/docs/transformers/master/en/main_classes/trainer.html#transformers.Trainer.train) with either:

- `resume_from_checkpoint=True` which will resume training from the latest checkpoint
- `resume_from_checkpoint=checkpoint_dir` which will resume training from the specific checkpoint in the directory
  passed.

In addition, you can easily save your checkpoints on the Model Hub when using `push_to_hub=True`. By default, all
the models saved in intermediate checkpoints are saved in different commits, but not the optimizer state. You can adapt
the `hub-strategy` value of your [TrainingArguments](/docs/transformers/master/en/main_classes/trainer.html#transformers.TrainingArguments) to either:

- `"checkpoint"`: the latest checkpoint is also pushed in a subfolder named last-checkpoint, allowing you to
  resume training easily with `trainer.train(resume_from_checkpoint="output_dir/last-checkpoint")`.
- `"all_checkpoints"`: all checkpoints are pushed like they appear in the output folder (so you will get one
  checkpoint folder per folder in your final repository)


## Logging

By default [Trainer](/docs/transformers/master/en/main_classes/trainer.html#transformers.Trainer) will use `logging.INFO` for the main process and `logging.WARNING` for
the replicas if any.

These defaults can be overridden to use any of the 5 `logging` levels with [TrainingArguments](/docs/transformers/master/en/main_classes/trainer.html#transformers.TrainingArguments)'s
arguments:

- `log_level` - for the main process
- `log_level_replica` - for the replicas

Further, if [TrainingArguments](/docs/transformers/master/en/main_classes/trainer.html#transformers.TrainingArguments)'s `log_on_each_node` is set to `False` only the main node will
use the log level settings for its main process, all other nodes will use the log level settings for replicas.

Note that [Trainer](/docs/transformers/master/en/main_classes/trainer.html#transformers.Trainer) is going to set `transformers`'s log level separately for each node in its
`__init__()`. So you may want to set this sooner (see the next example) if you tap into other
`transformers` functionality before creating the [Trainer](/docs/transformers/master/en/main_classes/trainer.html#transformers.Trainer) object.

Here is an example of how this can be used in an application:

```python
[...]
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

# Setup logging
logging.basicConfig(
format="%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(name)s - %(message)s",
datefmt="%m/%d/%Y %H:%M:%S",
handlers=[logging.StreamHandler(sys.stdout)],
)

# set the main code and the modules it uses to the same log-level according to the node
log_level = training_args.get_process_log_level()
logger.setLevel(log_level)
datasets.utils.logging.set_verbosity(log_level)
transformers.utils.logging.set_verbosity(log_level)

trainer = Trainer(...)
```

And then if you only want to see warnings on the main node and all other nodes to not print any most likely duplicated
warnings you could run it as:

```bash
my_app.py ... --log_level warning --log_level_replica error
```

In the multi-node environment if you also don't want the logs to repeat for each node's main process, you will want to
change the above to:

```bash
my_app.py ... --log_level warning --log_level_replica error --log_on_each_node 0
```

and then only the main process of the first node will log at the "warning" level, and all other processes on the main
node and all processes on other nodes will log at the "error" level.

If you need your application to be as quiet as possible you could do:

```bash
my_app.py ... --log_level error --log_level_replica error --log_on_each_node 0
```

(add `--log_on_each_node 0` if on multi-node environment)



## Randomness

When resuming from a checkpoint generated by [Trainer](/docs/transformers/master/en/main_classes/trainer.html#transformers.Trainer) all efforts are made to restore the
_python_, _numpy_ and _pytorch_ RNG states to the same states as they were at the moment of saving that checkpoint,
which should make the "stop and resume" style of training as close as possible to non-stop training.

However, due to various default non-deterministic pytorch settings this might not fully work. If you want full
determinism please refer to [Controlling sources of randomness](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/randomness.html). As explained in the document, that some of those settings
that make things deterministic (.e.g., `torch.backends.cudnn.deterministic`) may slow things down, therefore this
can't be done by default, but you can enable those yourself if needed.


## Trainer Integrations



The [Trainer](/docs/transformers/master/en/main_classes/trainer.html#transformers.Trainer) has been extended to support libraries that may dramatically improve your training
time and fit much bigger models.

Currently it supports third party solutions, [DeepSpeed](https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed) and [FairScale](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairscale/), which implement parts of the paper [ZeRO: Memory Optimizations
Toward Training Trillion Parameter Models, by Samyam Rajbhandari, Jeff Rasley, Olatunji Ruwase, Yuxiong He](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.02054).

This provided support is new and experimental as of this writing.

### CUDA Extension Installation Notes

As of this writing, both FairScale and Deepspeed require compilation of CUDA C++ code, before they can be used.

While all installation issues should be dealt with through the corresponding GitHub Issues of [FairScale](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairscale/issues) and [Deepspeed](https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed/issues), there are a few common issues that one may encounter while building
any PyTorch extension that needs to build CUDA extensions.

Therefore, if you encounter a CUDA-related build issue while doing one of the following or both:

```bash
pip install fairscale
pip install deepspeed
```

please, read the following notes first.

In these notes we give examples for what to do when `pytorch` has been built with CUDA `10.2`. If your situation is
different remember to adjust the version number to the one you are after.

#### Possible problem #1

While, Pytorch comes with its own CUDA toolkit, to build these two projects you must have an identical version of CUDA
installed system-wide.

For example, if you installed `pytorch` with `cudatoolkit==10.2` in the Python environment, you also need to have
CUDA `10.2` installed system-wide.

The exact location may vary from system to system, but `/usr/local/cuda-10.2` is the most common location on many
Unix systems. When CUDA is correctly set up and added to the `PATH` environment variable, one can find the
installation location by doing:

```bash
which nvcc
```

If you don't have CUDA installed system-wide, install it first. You will find the instructions by using your favorite
search engine. For example, if you're on Ubuntu you may want to search for: [ubuntu cuda 10.2 install](https://www.google.com/search?q=ubuntu+cuda+10.2+install).

#### Possible problem #2

Another possible common problem is that you may have more than one CUDA toolkit installed system-wide. For example you
may have:

```bash
/usr/local/cuda-10.2
/usr/local/cuda-11.0
```

Now, in this situation you need to make sure that your `PATH` and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variables contain
the correct paths to the desired CUDA version. Typically, package installers will set these to contain whatever the
last version was installed. If you encounter the problem, where the package build fails because it can't find the right
CUDA version despite you having it installed system-wide, it means that you need to adjust the 2 aforementioned
environment variables.

First, you may look at their contents:

```bash
echo $PATH
echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```

so you get an idea of what is inside.

It's possible that `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` is empty.

`PATH` lists the locations of where executables can be found and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` is for where shared libraries
are to looked for. In both cases, earlier entries have priority over the later ones. `:` is used to separate multiple
entries.

Now, to tell the build program where to find the specific CUDA toolkit, insert the desired paths to be listed first by
doing:

```bash
export PATH=/usr/local/cuda-10.2/bin:$PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda-10.2/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```

Note that we aren't overwriting the existing values, but prepending instead.

Of course, adjust the version number, the full path if need be. Check that the directories you assign actually do
exist. `lib64` sub-directory is where the various CUDA `.so` objects, like `libcudart.so` reside, it's unlikely
that your system will have it named differently, but if it is adjust it to reflect your reality.


#### Possible problem #3

Some older CUDA versions may refuse to build with newer compilers. For example, you my have `gcc-9` but it wants
`gcc-7`.

There are various ways to go about it.

If you can install the latest CUDA toolkit it typically should support the newer compiler.

Alternatively, you could install the lower version of the compiler in addition to the one you already have, or you may
already have it but it's not the default one, so the build system can't see it. If you have `gcc-7` installed but the
build system complains it can't find it, the following might do the trick:

```bash
sudo ln -s /usr/bin/gcc-7  /usr/local/cuda-10.2/bin/gcc
sudo ln -s /usr/bin/g++-7  /usr/local/cuda-10.2/bin/g++
```

Here, we are making a symlink to `gcc-7` from `/usr/local/cuda-10.2/bin/gcc` and since
`/usr/local/cuda-10.2/bin/` should be in the `PATH` environment variable (see the previous problem's solution), it
should find `gcc-7` (and `g++7`) and then the build will succeed.

As always make sure to edit the paths in the example to match your situation.

### FairScale

By integrating [FairScale](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairscale/) the [Trainer](/docs/transformers/master/en/main_classes/trainer.html#transformers.Trainer)
provides support for the following features from [the ZeRO paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.02054):

1. Optimizer State Sharding
2. Gradient Sharding
3. Model Parameters Sharding (new and very experimental)
4. CPU offload (new and very experimental)

You will need at least two GPUs to use this feature.


**Installation**:

Install the library via pypi:

```bash
pip install fairscale
```

or via `transformers`' `extras`:

```bash
pip install transformers[fairscale]
```

(will become available starting from `transformers==4.6.0`)

or find more details on [the FairScale's GitHub page](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairscale/#installation).

If you're still struggling with the build, first make sure to read [zero-install-notes](/docs/transformers/master/en/main_classes/trainer.html#zero-install-notes).

If it's still not resolved the build issue, here are a few more ideas.

`fairscale` seems to have an issue with the recently introduced by pip build isolation feature. If you have a problem
with it, you may want to try one of:

```bash
pip install fairscale --no-build-isolation .
```

or:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairscale/
cd fairscale
rm -r dist build
python setup.py bdist_wheel
pip uninstall -y fairscale
pip install dist/fairscale-*.whl
```

`fairscale` also has issues with building against pytorch-nightly, so if you use it you may have to try one of:

```bash
pip uninstall -y fairscale; pip install fairscale --pre \
-f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cu110/torch_nightly.html \
--no-cache --no-build-isolation
```

or:

```bash
pip install -v --disable-pip-version-check . \
-f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cu110/torch_nightly.html --pre
```

Of course, adjust the urls to match the cuda version you use.

If after trying everything suggested you still encounter build issues, please, proceed with the GitHub Issue of
[FairScale](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairscale/issues).



**Usage**:

To use the first version of Sharded data-parallelism, add `--sharded_ddp simple` to the command line arguments, and
make sure you have added the distributed launcher `-m torch.distributed.launch --nproc_per_node=NUMBER_OF_GPUS_YOU_HAVE` if you haven't been using it already.

For example here is how you could use it for `run_translation.py` with 2 GPUs:

```bash
python -m torch.distributed.launch --nproc_per_node=2 examples/pytorch/translation/run_translation.py \
--model_name_or_path t5-small --per_device_train_batch_size 1   \
--output_dir output_dir --overwrite_output_dir \
--do_train --max_train_samples 500 --num_train_epochs 1 \
--dataset_name wmt16 --dataset_config "ro-en" \
--source_lang en --target_lang ro \
--fp16 --sharded_ddp simple
```

Notes:

- This feature requires distributed training (so multiple GPUs).
- It is not implemented for TPUs.
- It works with `--fp16` too, to make things even faster.
- One of the main benefits of enabling `--sharded_ddp simple` is that it uses a lot less GPU memory, so you should be
  able to use significantly larger batch sizes using the same hardware (e.g. 3x and even bigger) which should lead to
  significantly shorter training time.

3. To use the second version of Sharded data-parallelism, add `--sharded_ddp zero_dp_2` or `--sharded_ddp zero_dp_3` to the command line arguments, and make sure you have added the distributed launcher `-m torch.distributed.launch --nproc_per_node=NUMBER_OF_GPUS_YOU_HAVE` if you haven't been using it already.

For example here is how you could use it for `run_translation.py` with 2 GPUs:

```bash
python -m torch.distributed.launch --nproc_per_node=2 examples/pytorch/translation/run_translation.py \
--model_name_or_path t5-small --per_device_train_batch_size 1   \
--output_dir output_dir --overwrite_output_dir \
--do_train --max_train_samples 500 --num_train_epochs 1 \
--dataset_name wmt16 --dataset_config "ro-en" \
--source_lang en --target_lang ro \
--fp16 --sharded_ddp zero_dp_2
```

`zero_dp_2` is an optimized version of the simple wrapper, while `zero_dp_3` fully shards model weights,
gradients and optimizer states.

Both are compatible with adding `cpu_offload` to enable ZeRO-offload (activate it like this: `--sharded_ddp "zero_dp_2 cpu_offload"`).

Notes:

- This feature requires distributed training (so multiple GPUs).
- It is not implemented for TPUs.
- It works with `--fp16` too, to make things even faster.
- The `cpu_offload` additional option requires `--fp16`.
- This is an area of active development, so make sure you have a source install of fairscale to use this feature as
  some bugs you encounter may have been fixed there already.

Known caveats:

- This feature is incompatible with `--predict_with_generate` in the _run_translation.py_ script.
- Using `--sharded_ddp zero_dp_3` requires wrapping each layer of the model in the special container
  `FullyShardedDataParallelism` of fairscale. It should be used with the option `auto_wrap` if you are not
  doing this yourself: `--sharded_ddp "zero_dp_3 auto_wrap"`.
