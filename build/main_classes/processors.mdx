# Processors

This library includes processors for several traditional tasks. These processors can be used to process a dataset into
examples that can be fed to a model.

## Processors

All processors follow the same architecture which is that of the
[DataProcessor](/docs/transformers/master/en/main_classes/processors.html#transformers.DataProcessor). The processor returns a list of
[InputExample](/docs/transformers/master/en/main_classes/processors.html#transformers.InputExample). These
[InputExample](/docs/transformers/master/en/main_classes/processors.html#transformers.InputExample) can be converted to
[InputFeatures](/docs/transformers/master/en/main_classes/processors.html#transformers.InputFeatures) in order to be fed to the model.

<a id='transformers.DataProcessor'></a>
> **class transformers.DataProcessor**()

Base class for data converters for sequence classification data sets.

<a id='transformers.DataProcessor.get_dev_examples'></a>
> **get\_dev\_examples**(self, data_dir)

Gets a collection of [InputExample](/docs/transformers/master/en/main_classes/processors.html#transformers.InputExample) for the dev set.

<a id='transformers.DataProcessor.get_example_from_tensor_dict'></a>
> **get\_example\_from\_tensor\_dict**(self, tensor_dict)


Gets an example from a dict with tensorflow tensors.

> Parameters

tensor_dict -- Keys and values should match the corresponding Glue
tensorflow_dataset examples.


<a id='transformers.DataProcessor.get_labels'></a>
> **get\_labels**(self)

Gets the list of labels for this data set.

<a id='transformers.DataProcessor.get_test_examples'></a>
> **get\_test\_examples**(self, data_dir)

Gets a collection of [InputExample](/docs/transformers/master/en/main_classes/processors.html#transformers.InputExample) for the test set.

<a id='transformers.DataProcessor.get_train_examples'></a>
> **get\_train\_examples**(self, data_dir)

Gets a collection of [InputExample](/docs/transformers/master/en/main_classes/processors.html#transformers.InputExample) for the train set.

<a id='transformers.DataProcessor.tfds_map'></a>
> **tfds\_map**(self, example)


Some tensorflow_datasets datasets are not formatted the same way the GLUE datasets are. This method converts
examples to the correct format.


<a id='transformers.InputExample'></a>
> **class transformers.InputExample**(guid: str, text_a: str, text_b: typing.Optional[str] = None, label: typing.Optional[str] = None)


A single training/test example for simple sequence classification.

> Parameters

guid -- Unique id for the example.
text_a -- string. The untokenized text of the first sequence. For single
sequence tasks, only this sequence must be specified.
text_b -- (Optional) string. The untokenized text of the second sequence.
Only must be specified for sequence pair tasks.
label -- (Optional) string. The label of the example. This should be
specified for train and dev examples, but not for test examples.


<a id='transformers.InputExample.to_json_string'></a>
> **to\_json\_string**(self)

Serializes this instance to a JSON string.

<a id='transformers.InputFeatures'></a>
> **class transformers.InputFeatures**(input_ids: typing.List[int], attention_mask: typing.Optional[typing.List[int]] = None, token_type_ids: typing.Optional[typing.List[int]] = None, label: typing.Union[int, float, NoneType] = None)


A single set of features of data. Property names are the same names as the corresponding inputs to a model.

> Parameters

input_ids -- Indices of input sequence tokens in the vocabulary.
attention_mask -- Mask to avoid performing attention on padding token indices.
Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`: Usually `1` for tokens that are NOT MASKED, `0` for MASKED (padded)
tokens.
token_type_ids -- (Optional) Segment token indices to indicate first and second
portions of the inputs. Only some models use them.
label -- (Optional) Label corresponding to the input. Int for classification problems,
float for regression problems.


<a id='transformers.InputFeatures.to_json_string'></a>
> **to\_json\_string**(self)

Serializes this instance to a JSON string.

## GLUE

[General Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE)](https://gluebenchmark.com/) is a benchmark that evaluates the
performance of models across a diverse set of existing NLU tasks. It was released together with the paper [GLUE: A
multi-task benchmark and analysis platform for natural language understanding](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=rJ4km2R5t7)

This library hosts a total of 10 processors for the following tasks: MRPC, MNLI, MNLI (mismatched), CoLA, SST2, STSB,
QQP, QNLI, RTE and WNLI.

Those processors are:

- `MrpcProcessor`
- `MnliProcessor`
- `MnliMismatchedProcessor`
- `Sst2Processor`
- `StsbProcessor`
- `QqpProcessor`
- `QnliProcessor`
- `RteProcessor`
- `WnliProcessor`

Additionally, the following method can be used to load values from a data file and convert them to a list of
[InputExample](/docs/transformers/master/en/main_classes/processors.html#transformers.InputExample).

automethod,transformers.data.processors.glue.glue_convert_examples_to_features


### Example usage

An example using these processors is given in the [run_glue.py](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/master/examples/legacy/text-classification/run_glue.py) script.


## XNLI

[The Cross-Lingual NLI Corpus (XNLI)](https://www.nyu.edu/projects/bowman/xnli/) is a benchmark that evaluates the
quality of cross-lingual text representations. XNLI is crowd-sourced dataset based on _MultiNLI
&amp;lt;http://www.nyu.edu/projects/bowman/multinli/>_: pairs of text are labeled with textual entailment annotations for 15
different languages (including both high-resource language such as English and low-resource languages such as Swahili).

It was released together with the paper [XNLI: Evaluating Cross-lingual Sentence Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.05053)

This library hosts the processor to load the XNLI data:

- `XnliProcessor`

Please note that since the gold labels are available on the test set, evaluation is performed on the test set.

An example using these processors is given in the [run_xnli.py](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/master/examples/legacy/text-classification/run_xnli.py) script.


## SQuAD

[The Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD)](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer//) is a benchmark that
evaluates the performance of models on question answering. Two versions are available, v1.1 and v2.0. The first version
(v1.1) was released together with the paper [SQuAD: 100,000+ Questions for Machine Comprehension of Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05250). The second version (v2.0) was released alongside the paper [Know What You Don't
Know: Unanswerable Questions for SQuAD](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.03822).

This library hosts a processor for each of the two versions:

### Processors

Those processors are:

- `SquadV1Processor`
- `SquadV2Processor`

They both inherit from the abstract class `SquadProcessor`

<a id='transformers.data.processors.squad.SquadProcessor'></a>
> **class transformers.data.processors.squad.SquadProcessor**()


Processor for the SQuAD data set. overridden by SquadV1Processor and SquadV2Processor, used by the version 1.1 and
version 2.0 of SQuAD, respectively.


<a id='transformers.data.processors.squad.SquadProcessor.get_dev_examples'></a>
> **get\_dev\_examples**(self, data_dir, filename = None)


Returns the evaluation example from the data directory.

> Parameters

data_dir -- Directory containing the data files used for training and evaluating.
filename -- None by default, specify this if the evaluation file has a different name than the original one
which is _dev-v1.1.json_ and _dev-v2.0.json_ for squad versions 1.1 and 2.0 respectively.


<a id='transformers.data.processors.squad.SquadProcessor.get_examples_from_dataset'></a>
> **get\_examples\_from\_dataset**(self, dataset, evaluate = False)


Creates a list of `SquadExample` using a TFDS dataset.

> Parameters

dataset -- The tfds dataset loaded from _tensorflow_datasets.load("squad")_
evaluate -- Boolean specifying if in evaluation mode or in training mode

> Returns

List of SquadExample

> Examples:

```python
>>> import tensorflow_datasets as tfds
>>> dataset = tfds.load("squad")

>>> training_examples = get_examples_from_dataset(dataset, evaluate=False)
>>> evaluation_examples = get_examples_from_dataset(dataset, evaluate=True)
```


<a id='transformers.data.processors.squad.SquadProcessor.get_train_examples'></a>
> **get\_train\_examples**(self, data_dir, filename = None)


Returns the training examples from the data directory.

> Parameters

data_dir -- Directory containing the data files used for training and evaluating.
filename -- None by default, specify this if the training file has a different name than the original one
which is _train-v1.1.json_ and _train-v2.0.json_ for squad versions 1.1 and 2.0 respectively.



Additionally, the following method can be used to convert SQuAD examples into
`SquadFeatures` that can be used as model inputs.

automethod,transformers.data.processors.squad.squad_convert_examples_to_features


These processors as well as the aforementionned method can be used with files containing the data as well as with the
_tensorflow_datasets_ package. Examples are given below.


### Example usage

Here is an example using the processors as well as the conversion method using data files:

```
# Loading a V2 processor
processor = SquadV2Processor()
examples = processor.get_dev_examples(squad_v2_data_dir)

# Loading a V1 processor
processor = SquadV1Processor()
examples = processor.get_dev_examples(squad_v1_data_dir)

features = squad_convert_examples_to_features( 
examples=examples,
tokenizer=tokenizer,
max_seq_length=max_seq_length,
doc_stride=args.doc_stride,
max_query_length=max_query_length,
is_training=not evaluate,
)
```

Using _tensorflow_datasets_ is as easy as using a data file:

```
# tensorflow_datasets only handle Squad V1.
tfds_examples = tfds.load("squad")
examples = SquadV1Processor().get_examples_from_dataset(tfds_examples, evaluate=evaluate)

features = squad_convert_examples_to_features( 
examples=examples,
tokenizer=tokenizer,
max_seq_length=max_seq_length,
doc_stride=args.doc_stride,
max_query_length=max_query_length,
is_training=not evaluate,
)
```

Another example using these processors is given in the [run_squad.py](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/master/examples/legacy/question-answering/run_squad.py) script.
