# BigBirdPegasus

## Overview

The BigBird model was proposed in [Big Bird: Transformers for Longer Sequences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.14062) by
Zaheer, Manzil and Guruganesh, Guru and Dubey, Kumar Avinava and Ainslie, Joshua and Alberti, Chris and Ontanon,
Santiago and Pham, Philip and Ravula, Anirudh and Wang, Qifan and Yang, Li and others. BigBird, is a sparse-attention
based transformer which extends Transformer based models, such as BERT to much longer sequences. In addition to sparse
attention, BigBird also applies global attention as well as random attention to the input sequence. Theoretically, it
has been shown that applying sparse, global, and random attention approximates full attention, while being
computationally much more efficient for longer sequences. As a consequence of the capability to handle longer context,
BigBird has shown improved performance on various long document NLP tasks, such as question answering and
summarization, compared to BERT or RoBERTa.

The abstract from the paper is the following:

*Transformers-based models, such as BERT, have been one of the most successful deep learning models for NLP.
Unfortunately, one of their core limitations is the quadratic dependency (mainly in terms of memory) on the sequence
length due to their full attention mechanism. To remedy this, we propose, BigBird, a sparse attention mechanism that
reduces this quadratic dependency to linear. We show that BigBird is a universal approximator of sequence functions and
is Turing complete, thereby preserving these properties of the quadratic, full attention model. Along the way, our
theoretical analysis reveals some of the benefits of having O(1) global tokens (such as CLS), that attend to the entire
sequence as part of the sparse attention mechanism. The proposed sparse attention can handle sequences of length up to
8x of what was previously possible using similar hardware. As a consequence of the capability to handle longer context,
BigBird drastically improves performance on various NLP tasks such as question answering and summarization. We also
propose novel applications to genomics data.*

Tips:

- For an in-detail explanation on how BigBird's attention works, see [this blog post](https://huggingface.co/blog/big-bird).
- BigBird comes with 2 implementations: **original_full** & **block_sparse**. For the sequence length < 1024, using
  **original_full** is advised as there is no benefit in using **block_sparse** attention.
- The code currently uses window size of 3 blocks and 2 global blocks.
- Sequence length must be divisible by block size.
- Current implementation supports only **ITC**.
- Current implementation doesn't support **num_random_blocks = 0**.
- BigBirdPegasus uses the [PegasusTokenizer](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/master/src/transformers/models/pegasus/tokenization_pegasus.py).

The original code can be found [here](https://github.com/google-research/bigbird).

This is the configuration class to store the configuration of a [BigBirdPegasusModel](model_doc/bigbird_pegasus.html#transformers.BigBirdPegasusModel). It is
used to instantiate an BigBirdPegasus model according to the specified arguments, defining the model architecture.
Instantiating a configuration with the defaults will yield a similar configuration to that of the BigBirdPegasus
[google/bigbird-pegasus-large-arxiv](https://huggingface.co/google/bigbird-pegasus-large-arxiv) architecture.

Configuration objects inherit from [PretrainedConfig](main_classes/configuration.html#transformers.PretrainedConfig) and can be used to control the model

## BigBirdPegasusModel

<a id='transformers.BigBirdPegasusModel'></a>
> **class transformers.BigBirdPegasusModel**(config: BigBirdPegasusConfig)

The bare BigBirdPegasus Model outputting raw hidden-states without any specific head on top.
This model inherits from [PreTrainedModel](main_classes/model.html#transformers.PreTrainedModel). Check the superclass documentation for the generic
methods the library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input embeddings
etc.)

This model is also a PyTorch [torch.nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module)
subclass. Use it as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to
general usage and behavior.

> Parameters

- **config** ([BigBirdPegasusConfig](model_doc/bigbird_pegasus.html#transformers.BigBirdPegasusConfig)) --
  Model configuration class with all the parameters of the model. Initializing with a config file does not
  load the weights associated with the model, only the configuration. Check out the
  [from_pretrained()](main_classes/model.html#transformers.PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained) method to load the model weights.


<a id='transformers.BigBirdPegasusModel.forward'></a>
> **forward**(self, input_ids = None, attention_mask = None, decoder_input_ids = None, decoder_attention_mask = None, head_mask = None, decoder_head_mask = None, cross_attn_head_mask = None, encoder_outputs = None, past_key_values = None, inputs_embeds = None, decoder_inputs_embeds = None, use_cache = None, output_attentions = None, output_hidden_states = None, return_dict = None)

The [BigBirdPegasusModel](model_doc/bigbird_pegasus.html#transformers.BigBirdPegasusModel) forward method, overrides the `__call__` special method.

<Tip>

Although the recipe for forward pass needs to be defined within this function, one should call the
`Module` instance afterwards instead of this since the former takes care of running the pre and post
processing steps while the latter silently ignores them.

</Tip>

> Parameters

- **input_ids** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`) --
  Indices of input sequence tokens in the vocabulary. Padding will be ignored by default should you provide
  it.

  Indices can be obtained using [PegasusTokenizer](model_doc/pegasus.html#transformers.PegasusTokenizer). See
  [transformers.PreTrainedTokenizer.encode()](internal/tokenization_utils.html#transformers.PreTrainedTokenizerBase.encode) and [transformers.PreTrainedTokenizer.__call__()](internal/tokenization_utils.html#transformers.PreTrainedTokenizerBase.__call__) for
  details.

  [What are input IDs?](../glossary.html#input-ids)
- **attention_mask** (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, _optional_) --
  Mask to avoid performing attention on padding token indices. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:

  - 1 for tokens that are **not masked**,
  - 0 for tokens that are **masked**.

  [What are attention masks?](../glossary.html#attention-mask)
- **decoder_input_ids** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, target_sequence_length)`, _optional_) --
  Provide for translation and summarization training. By default, the model will create this tensor by
  shifting the `input_ids` to the right, following the paper.
- **decoder_attention_mask** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, target_sequence_length)`, _optional_) --
  Default behavior: generate a tensor that ignores pad tokens in `decoder_input_ids`. Causal mask will
  also be used by default.

  If you want to change padding behavior, you should read
  `modeling_bigbird_pegasus._prepare_decoder_inputs` and modify to your needs. See diagram 1 in [the
  paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.13461) for more information on the default strategy.

- **decoder_head_mask** (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(num_layers, num_heads)`, _optional_) --
  Mask to nullify selected heads of the attention modules in the decoder. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:

  - 1 indicates the head is **not masked**,
  - 0 indicates the head is **masked**.

- **encoder_outputs** (`tuple(tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`, _optional_) --
  Tuple consists of (`last_hidden_state`, _optional_: `hidden_states`, _optional_:
  `attentions`) `last_hidden_state` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`,
  _optional_) is a sequence of hidden-states at the output of the last layer of the encoder. Used in the

  Contains pre-computed hidden-states (key and values in the self-attention blocks and in the cross-attention
  blocks) that can be used (see `past_key_values` input) to speed up sequential decoding.

  If `past_key_values` are used, the user can optionally input only the last `decoder_input_ids`
  (those that don't have their past key value states given to this model) of shape `(batch_size, 1)`
  instead of all ``decoder_input_ids``` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`. - **inputs_embeds** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`, _optional_) -- Optionally, instead of passing `input_ids` you can choose to directly pass an embedded representation. This is useful if you want more control over how to convert `input_ids` indices into associated

  have to be input (see `past_key_values`). This is useful if you want more control over how to convert
  `decoder_input_ids` indices into associated vectors than the model's internal embedding lookup matrix.

  If `decoder_input_ids` and `decoder_inputs_embeds` are both unset, `decoder_inputs_embeds`
  takes the value of `inputs_embeds`.

  decoding (see `past_key_values`).

  more detail.
- **return_dict** (`bool`, _optional_) --
  Whether or not to return a [ModelOutput](main_classes/output.html#transformers.file_utils.ModelOutput) instead of a plain tuple.

## BigBirdPegasusForSequenceClassification

<a id='transformers.BigBirdPegasusForSequenceClassification'></a>
> **class transformers.BigBirdPegasusForSequenceClassification**(config: BigBirdPegasusConfig, **kwargs)


BigBirdPegasus model with a sequence classification/head on top (a linear layer on top of the pooled output) e.g.
for GLUE tasks.

This model inherits from [PreTrainedModel](main_classes/model.html#transformers.PreTrainedModel). Check the superclass documentation for the generic
methods the library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input embeddings
etc.)

This model is also a PyTorch [torch.nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module)
subclass. Use it as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to
general usage and behavior.

> Parameters

- **config** ([BigBirdPegasusConfig](model_doc/bigbird_pegasus.html#transformers.BigBirdPegasusConfig)) --
  Model configuration class with all the parameters of the model. Initializing with a config file does not
  load the weights associated with the model, only the configuration. Check out the
  [from_pretrained()](main_classes/model.html#transformers.PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained) method to load the model weights.

The [BigBirdPegasusForSequenceClassification](model_doc/bigbird_pegasus.html#transformers.BigBirdPegasusForSequenceClassification) forward method, overrides the `__call__` special method.

<Tip>

Although the recipe for forward pass needs to be defined within this function, one should call the
`Module` instance afterwards instead of this since the former takes care of running the pre and post
processing steps while the latter silently ignores them.

</Tip>

> Parameters

- **input_ids** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`) --
  Indices of input sequence tokens in the vocabulary. Padding will be ignored by default should you provide
  it.

  Indices can be obtained using [PegasusTokenizer](model_doc/pegasus.html#transformers.PegasusTokenizer). See
  [transformers.PreTrainedTokenizer.encode()](internal/tokenization_utils.html#transformers.PreTrainedTokenizerBase.encode) and [transformers.PreTrainedTokenizer.__call__()](internal/tokenization_utils.html#transformers.PreTrainedTokenizerBase.__call__) for
  details.

  [What are input IDs?](../glossary.html#input-ids)
- **attention_mask** (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, _optional_) --
  Mask to avoid performing attention on padding token indices. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:

  - 1 for tokens that are **not masked**,
  - 0 for tokens that are **masked**.

  [What are attention masks?](../glossary.html#attention-mask)
- **decoder_input_ids** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, target_sequence_length)`, _optional_) --
  Provide for translation and summarization training. By default, the model will create this tensor by
  shifting the `input_ids` to the right, following the paper.
- **decoder_attention_mask** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, target_sequence_length)`, _optional_) --
  Default behavior: generate a tensor that ignores pad tokens in `decoder_input_ids`. Causal mask will
  also be used by default.

  If you want to change padding behavior, you should read
  `modeling_bigbird_pegasus._prepare_decoder_inputs` and modify to your needs. See diagram 1 in [the
  paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.13461) for more information on the default strategy.

- **decoder_head_mask** (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(num_layers, num_heads)`, _optional_) --
  Mask to nullify selected heads of the attention modules in the decoder. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:

  - 1 indicates the head is **not masked**,
  - 0 indicates the head is **masked**.

- **encoder_outputs** (`tuple(tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`, _optional_) --
  Tuple consists of (`last_hidden_state`, _optional_: `hidden_states`, _optional_:
  `attentions`) `last_hidden_state` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`,
  _optional_) is a sequence of hidden-states at the output of the last layer of the encoder. Used in the
  cross-attention of the decoder.
- **past_key_values** (`tuple(tuple(torch.FloatTensor))`, _optional_, returned when `use_cache=True` is passed or when `config.use_cache=True`) --

  shape `(batch_size, num_heads, encoder_sequence_length, embed_size_per_head)`.

  Contains pre-computed hidden-states (key and values in the self-attention blocks and in the cross-attention
  blocks) that can be used (see `past_key_values` input) to speed up sequential decoding.

  If `past_key_values` are used, the user can optionally input only the last `decoder_input_ids`
  (those that don't have their past key value states given to this model) of shape `(batch_size, 1)`
  instead of all ``decoder_input_ids``` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`. - **inputs_embeds** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`, _optional_) -- Optionally, instead of passing `input_ids` you can choose to directly pass an embedded representation. This is useful if you want more control over how to convert `input_ids` indices into associated
  vectors than the model's internal embedding lookup matrix.
- **decoder_inputs_embeds** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, target_sequence_length, hidden_size)`, _optional_) --
  Optionally, instead of passing `decoder_input_ids` you can choose to directly pass an embedded
  representation. If `past_key_values` is used, optionally only the last `decoder_inputs_embeds`
  have to be input (see `past_key_values`). This is useful if you want more control over how to convert
  `decoder_input_ids` indices into associated vectors than the model's internal embedding lookup matrix.

  If `decoder_input_ids` and `decoder_inputs_embeds` are both unset, `decoder_inputs_embeds`
  takes the value of `inputs_embeds`.
- **use_cache** (`bool`, _optional_) --
  If set to `True`, `past_key_values` key value states are returned and can be used to speed up
  decoding (see `past_key_values`).
- **output_attentions** (`bool`, _optional_) --
  Whether or not to return the attentions tensors of all attention layers. See `attentions` under returned
  tensors for more detail.
- **output_hidden_states** (`bool`, _optional_) --
  Whether or not to return the hidden states of all layers. See `hidden_states` under returned tensors for
  more detail.
- **return_dict** (`bool`, _optional_) --
  Whether or not to return a [ModelOutput](main_classes/output.html#transformers.file_utils.ModelOutput) instead of a plain tuple.

- **labels** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size,)`, _optional_) --
  Labels for computing the sequence classification/regression loss. Indices should be in `[0, ..., config.num_labels - 1]`. If `config.num_labels > 1` a classification loss is computed (Cross-Entropy).

- **input_ids** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`) --
  Indices of input sequence tokens in the vocabulary. Padding will be ignored by default should you
  provide it.

  Indices can be obtained using `BigBirdPegasusTokenizer`. See
  [transformers.PreTrainedTokenizer.encode()](internal/tokenization_utils.html#transformers.PreTrainedTokenizerBase.encode) and [transformers.PreTrainedTokenizer.__call__()](internal/tokenization_utils.html#transformers.PreTrainedTokenizerBase.__call__)
  for details.

  [What are input IDs?](../glossary.html#input-ids)
- **attention_mask** (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, _optional_) --
  Mask to avoid performing attention on padding token indices. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:

  - 1 for tokens that are **not masked**,
  - 0 for tokens that are **masked**.

  [What are attention masks?](../glossary.html#attention-mask)
- **encoder_hidden_states**  (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`, _optional_) --
  Sequence of hidden-states at the output of the last layer of the encoder. Used in the cross-attention
  if the model is configured as a decoder.
- **encoder_attention_mask** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, _optional_) --
  Mask to avoid performing attention on the padding token indices of the encoder input. This mask is used
  in the cross-attention if the model is configured as a decoder. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:
- **head_mask** (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(decoder_layers, decoder_attention_heads)`, _optional_) --
  Mask to nullify selected heads of the attention modules. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:

  - 1 indicates the head is **not masked**,
  - 0 indicates the head is **masked**.

- **cross_attn_head_mask** (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(decoder_layers, decoder_attention_heads)`, _optional_) --
  Mask to nullify selected heads of the cross-attention modules. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:

  - 1 indicates the head is **not masked**,
  - 0 indicates the head is **masked**.

- **past_key_values** (`tuple(tuple(torch.FloatTensor))`, _optional_, returned when `use_cache=True` is passed or when `config.use_cache=True`) --
  Tuple of `tuple(torch.FloatTensor)` of length `config.n_layers`, with each tuple having 2
  tensors of shape `(batch_size, num_heads, sequence_length, embed_size_per_head)`) and 2 additional
  tensors of shape `(batch_size, num_heads, encoder_sequence_length, embed_size_per_head)`. The two
  additional tensors are only required when the model is used as a decoder in a Sequence to Sequence
  model.

  Contains pre-computed hidden-states (key and values in the self-attention blocks and in the
  cross-attention blocks) that can be used (see `past_key_values` input) to speed up sequential
  decoding.

  If `past_key_values` are used, the user can optionally input only the last `decoder_input_ids`
  (those that don't have their past key value states given to this model) of shape `(batch_size, 1)`
  instead of all `decoder_input_ids` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`.
- **labels** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, _optional_) --
  Labels for computing the masked language modeling loss. Indices should either be in `[0, ..., config.vocab_size]` or -100 (see `input_ids` docstring). Tokens with indices set to `-100` are
  ignored (masked), the loss is only computed for the tokens with labels in `[0, ..., config.vocab_size]`.
- **use_cache** (`bool`, _optional_) --
  If set to `True`, `past_key_values` key value states are returned and can be used to speed up
  decoding (see `past_key_values`).

  - 1 for tokens that are **not masked**,
  - 0 for tokens that are **masked**.
- **output_attentions** (`bool`, _optional_) --
  Whether or not to return the attentions tensors of all attention layers. See `attentions` under
  returned tensors for more detail.
- **output_hidden_states** (`bool`, _optional_) --
  Whether or not to return the hidden states of all layers. See `hidden_states` under returned tensors
  for more detail.
- **return_dict** (`bool`, _optional_) --
  Whether or not to return a [ModelOutput](main_classes/output.html#transformers.file_utils.ModelOutput) instead of a plain tuple.


> Returns

A [CausalLMOutputWithCrossAttentions](main_classes/output.html#transformers.modeling_outputs.CausalLMOutputWithCrossAttentions) or a tuple of
`torch.FloatTensor` (if `return_dict=False` is passed or when `config.return_dict=False`) comprising
various elements depending on the configuration ([BigBirdPegasusConfig](model_doc/bigbird_pegasus.html#transformers.BigBirdPegasusConfig)) and inputs.

  Hidden-states of the model at the output of each layer plus the initial embedding outputs.
- **attentions** (`tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`, _optional_, returned when `output_attentions=True` is passed or when `config.output_attentions=True`) -- Tuple of `torch.FloatTensor` (one for each layer) of shape `(batch_size, num_heads, sequence_length, sequence_length)`.

  Attentions weights after the attention softmax, used to compute the weighted average in the self-attention
  heads.
- **cross_attentions** (`tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`, _optional_, returned when `output_attentions=True` is passed or when `config.output_attentions=True`) -- Tuple of `torch.FloatTensor` (one for each layer) of shape `(batch_size, num_heads, sequence_length, sequence_length)`.

  Cross attentions weights after the attention softmax, used to compute the weighted average in the
  cross-attention heads.
- **past_key_values** (`tuple(tuple(torch.FloatTensor))`, _optional_, returned when `use_cache=True` is passed or when `config.use_cache=True`) -- Tuple of `torch.FloatTensor` tuples of length `config.n_layers`, with each tuple containing the
  cached key, value states of the self-attention and the cross-attention layers if model is used in
  encoder-decoder setting. Only relevant if `config.is_decoder = True`.

  Contains pre-computed hidden-states (key and values in the attention blocks) that can be used (see
  `past_key_values` input) to speed up sequential decoding.


> Example:

```python
>>> from transformers import BigBirdPegasusTokenizer, BigBirdPegasusForCausalLM

>>> tokenizer = BigBirdPegasusTokenizer.from_pretrained("google/bigbird-pegasus-large-arxiv")
>>> model = BigBirdPegasusForCausalLM.from_pretrained("google/bigbird-pegasus-large-arxiv", add_cross_attention=False)
>>> assert model.config.is_decoder, f"{model.__class__} has to be configured as a decoder."
>>> inputs = tokenizer("Hello, my dog is cute", return_tensors="pt")
>>> outputs = model(**inputs)

>>> last_hidden_states = outputs.last_hidden_state
