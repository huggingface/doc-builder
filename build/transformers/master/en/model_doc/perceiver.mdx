<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

The Perceiver IO model was proposed in [Perceiver IO: A General Architecture for Structured Inputs & Outputs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.14795) by Andrew Jaegle, Sebastian Borgeaud, Jean-Baptiste Alayrac, Carl Doersch,
Catalin Ionescu, David Ding, Skanda Koppula, Daniel Zoran, Andrew Brock, Evan Shelhamer, Olivier Hénaff, Matthew M.
Botvinick, Andrew Zisserman, Oriol Vinyals, João Carreira.

Perceiver IO is a generalization of [Perceiver](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.03206) to handle arbitrary outputs in
addition to arbitrary inputs. The original Perceiver only produced a single classification label. In addition to
classification labels, Perceiver IO can produce (for example) language, optical flow, and multimodal videos with audio.
This is done using the same building blocks as the original Perceiver. The computational complexity of Perceiver IO is
linear in the input and output size and the bulk of the processing occurs in the latent space, allowing us to process
inputs and outputs that are much larger than can be handled by standard Transformers. This means, for example,
Perceiver IO can do BERT-style masked language modeling directly using bytes instead of tokenized inputs.

The abstract from the paper is the following:

*The recently-proposed Perceiver model obtains good results on several domains (images, audio, multimodal, point
clouds) while scaling linearly in compute and memory with the input size. While the Perceiver supports many kinds of
inputs, it can only produce very simple outputs such as class scores. Perceiver IO overcomes this limitation without
sacrificing the original's appealing properties by learning to flexibly query the model's latent space to produce
outputs of arbitrary size and semantics. Perceiver IO still decouples model depth from data size and still scales
linearly with data size, but now with respect to both input and output sizes. The full Perceiver IO model achieves
strong results on tasks with highly structured output spaces, such as natural language and visual understanding,
StarCraft II, and multi-task and multi-modal domains. As highlights, Perceiver IO matches a Transformer-based BERT
baseline on the GLUE language benchmark without the need for input tokenization and achieves state-of-the-art
performance on Sintel optical flow estimation.*

Here's a TLDR explaining how Perceiver works:

The main problem with the self-attention mechanism of the Transformer is that the time and memory requirements scale
quadratically with the sequence length. Hence, models like BERT and RoBERTa are limited to a max sequence length of 512
tokens. Perceiver aims to solve this issue by, instead of performing self-attention on the inputs, perform it on a set
of latent variables, and only use the inputs for cross-attention. In this way, the time and memory requirements don't
depend on the length of the inputs anymore, as one uses a fixed amount of latent variables, like 256 or 512. These are
randomly initialized, after which they are trained end-to-end using backpropagation.

Internally, [PerceiverModel](/docs/transformers/master/en/model_doc/perceiver#transformers.PerceiverModel) will create the latents, which is a tensor of shape
`(batch_size, num_latents, d_latents)`. One must provide `inputs` (which could be text, images, audio, you
name it!) to the model, which it will use to perform cross-attention with the latents. The output of the Perceiver
encoder is a tensor of the same shape. One can then, similar to BERT, convert the last hidden states of the latents to
classification logits by averaging along the sequence dimension, and placing a linear layer on top of that to project
the `d_latents` to `num_labels`.

This was the idea of the original Perceiver paper. However, it could only output classification logits. In a follow-up
work, PerceiverIO, they generalized it to let the model also produce outputs of arbitrary size. How, you might ask? The
idea is actually relatively simple: one defines outputs of an arbitrary size, and then applies cross-attention with the
last hidden states of the latents, using the outputs as queries, and the latents as keys and values.

So let's say one wants to perform masked language modeling (BERT-style) with the Perceiver. As the Perceiver's input
length will not have an impact on the computation time of the self-attention layers, one can provide raw bytes,
providing `inputs` of length 2048 to the model. If one now masks out certain of these 2048 tokens, one can define
the `outputs` as being of shape: `(batch_size, 2048, 768)`. Next, one performs cross-attention with the final
hidden states of the latents to update the `outputs` tensor. After cross-attention, one still has a tensor of
shape `(batch_size, 2048, 768)`. One can then place a regular language modeling head on top, to project the last
dimension to the vocabulary size of the model, i.e. creating logits of shape `(batch_size, 2048, 262)` (as
Perceiver uses a vocabulary size of 262 byte IDs).

This is the configuration class to store the configuration of a [PerceiverModel](/docs/transformers/master/en/model_doc/perceiver#transformers.PerceiverModel). It is used
to instantiate an Perceiver model according to the specified arguments, defining the model architecture.
Instantiating a configuration with the defaults will yield a similar configuration to that of the Perceiver
[deepmind/language-perceiver](https://huggingface.co/deepmind/language-perceiver) architecture.

Configuration objects inherit from [PretrainedConfig](/docs/transformers/master/en/main_classes/configuration#transformers.PretrainedConfig) and can be used to control the model
outputs. Read the documentation from [PretrainedConfig](/docs/transformers/master/en/main_classes/configuration#transformers.PretrainedConfig) for more information.



Example:

```python
>>> from transformers import PerceiverModel, PerceiverConfig

>>> # Initializing a Perceiver deepmind/language-perceiver style configuration
>>> configuration = PerceiverConfig()

>>> # Initializing a model from the deepmind/language-perceiver style configuration
>>> model = PerceiverModel(configuration)

>>> # Accessing the model configuration
>>> configuration = model.config

<Tip>

Although the recipe for forward pass needs to be defined within this function, one should call the
`Module` instance afterwards instead of this since the former takes care of running the pre and post
processing steps while the latter silently ignores them.

```python
>>> from transformers import PerceiverTokenizer, PerceiverModel
>>> import torch

>>> tokenizer = PerceiverTokenizer.from_pretrained('deepmind/language-perceiver')
>>> model = PerceiverModel.from_pretrained('deepmind/language-perceiver')

Example use of Perceiver for optical flow, for tasks such as Sintel and KITTI. _PerceiverForOpticalFlow_ uses
_transformers.models.perceiver.modeling_perceiver.PerceiverImagePreprocessor_ (with _prep_type_ = "patches") to
preprocess the input images, and _transformers.models.perceiver.modeling_perceiver.PerceiverOpticalFlowDecoder_ to
decode the latent representation of _~transformers.PerceiverModel_.

As input, one concatenates 2 subsequent frames along the channel dimension and extract a 3 x 3 patch around each pixel
(leading to 3 x 3 x 3 x 2 = 54 values for each pixel). Fixed Fourier position encodings are used to encode the position
of each pixel in the patch. Next, one applies the Perceiver encoder. To decode, one queries the latent representation
using the same encoding used for the input.

This model is a PyTorch [torch.nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module) sub-class. Use
it as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to general usage and

Example use of Perceiver for multimodal (video) autoencoding, for tasks such as Kinetics-700.

_PerceiverForMultimodalAutoencoding_ uses
_transformers.models.perceiver.modeling_perceiver.PerceiverMultimodalPreprocessor_ to preprocess the 3 modalities:
images, audio and class labels. This preprocessor uses modality-specific preprocessors to preprocess every modality
separately, after which they are concatenated. Trainable position embeddings are used to pad each modality to the same
number of channels to make concatenation along the time dimension possible. Next, one applies the Perceiver encoder.

_transformers.models.perceiver.modeling_perceiver.PerceiverMultimodalDecoder_ is used to decode the latent
representation of _~transformers.PerceiverModel_. This decoder uses each modality-specific decoder to construct
queries. The decoder queries are created based on the inputs after preprocessing. However, autoencoding an entire video
in a single forward pass is computationally infeasible, hence one only uses parts of the decoder queries to do
cross-attention with the latent representation. This is determined by the subsampled indices for each modality, which
can be provided as additional input to the forward pass of _PerceiverForMultimodalAutoencoding_.

_transformers.models.perceiver.modeling_perceiver.PerceiverMultimodalDecoder_ also pads the decoder queries of the
different modalities to the same number of channels, in order to concatenate them along the time dimension. Next,
cross-attention is performed with the latent representation of _PerceiverModel_.

Finally, _transformers.models.perceiver.modeling_perceiver.PerceiverMultiModalPostprocessor_ is used to turn this
tensor into an actual video. It first splits up the output into the different modalities, and then applies the
respective postprocessor for each modality.

Note that, by masking the classification label during evaluation (i.e. simply providing a tensor of zeros for the
"label" modality), this auto-encoding model becomes a Kinetics 700 video classifier.

This model is a PyTorch [torch.nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module) sub-class. Use
it as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to general usage and
behavior.
