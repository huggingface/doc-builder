<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

The T5 model was presented in [Exploring the Limits of Transfer Learning with a Unified Text-to-Text Transformer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.10683.pdf) by Colin Raffel, Noam Shazeer, Adam Roberts, Katherine Lee, Sharan Narang,
Michael Matena, Yanqi Zhou, Wei Li, Peter J. Liu.

The abstract from the paper is the following:

*Transfer learning, where a model is first pre-trained on a data-rich task before being fine-tuned on a downstream
task, has emerged as a powerful technique in natural language processing (NLP). The effectiveness of transfer learning
has given rise to a diversity of approaches, methodology, and practice. In this paper, we explore the landscape of
transfer learning techniques for NLP by introducing a unified framework that converts every language problem into a
text-to-text format. Our systematic study compares pretraining objectives, architectures, unlabeled datasets, transfer
approaches, and other factors on dozens of language understanding tasks. By combining the insights from our exploration
with scale and our new "Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus", we achieve state-of-the-art results on many benchmarks covering
summarization, question answering, text classification, and more. To facilitate future work on transfer learning for
NLP, we release our dataset, pre-trained models, and code.*

Tips:

- T5 is an encoder-decoder model pre-trained on a multi-task mixture of unsupervised and supervised tasks and for which
  each task is converted into a text-to-text format. T5 works well on a variety of tasks out-of-the-box by prepending a
  different prefix to the input corresponding to each task, e.g., for translation: *translate English to German: ...*,
  for summarization: *summarize: ...*.

- T5 uses relative scalar embeddings. Encoder input padding can be done on the left and on the right.

- See the [training](/docs/transformers/master/en/model_doc/t5#training), [inference](/docs/transformers/master/en/model_doc/t5#inference) and [scripts](/docs/transformers/master/en/model_doc/t5#scripts) sections below for all details regarding usage.

T5 comes in different sizes:

- [t5-small](https://huggingface.co/t5-small)

- [t5-base](https://huggingface.co/t5-base)

- [t5-large](https://huggingface.co/t5-large)

- [t5-3b](https://huggingface.co/t5-3b)

- [t5-11b](https://huggingface.co/t5-11b).

Based on the original T5 model, Google has released some follow-up works:

- **T5v1.1**: T5v1.1 is an improved version of T5 with some architectural tweaks, and is pre-trained on C4 only without
  mixing in the supervised tasks. Refer to the documentation of T5v1.1 which can be found [here](/docs/transformers/master/en/t5v1.1).

- **mT5**: mT5 is a multilingual T5 model. It is pre-trained on the mC4 corpus, which includes 101 languages. Refer to
  the documentation of mT5 which can be found [here](/docs/transformers/master/en/mt5).

- **byT5**: byT5 is a T5 model pre-trained on byte sequences rather than SentencePiece subword token sequences. Refer
  to the documentation of byT5 which can be found [here](/docs/transformers/master/en/byt5).

All checkpoints can be found on the [hub](https://huggingface.co/models?search=t5).

This model was contributed by [thomwolf](https://huggingface.co/thomwolf). The original code can be found [here](https://github.com/google-research/text-to-text-transfer-transformer).

<a id='training'></a>

<h2 id="training">Training</h2>

T5 is an encoder-decoder model and converts all NLP problems into a text-to-text format. It is trained using teacher
forcing. This means that for training, we always need an input sequence and a corresponding target sequence. The input
sequence is fed to the model using `input_ids`. The target sequence is shifted to the right, i.e., prepended by a
start-sequence token and fed to the decoder using the `decoder_input_ids`. In teacher-forcing style, the target
sequence is then appended by the EOS token and corresponds to the `labels`. The PAD token is hereby used as the
start-sequence token. T5 can be trained / fine-tuned both in a supervised and unsupervised fashion.

One can use [T5ForConditionalGeneration](/docs/transformers/master/en/model_doc/t5#transformers.T5ForConditionalGeneration) (or the Tensorflow/Flax variant), which includes the
language modeling head on top of the decoder.

- Unsupervised denoising training

  In this setup, spans of the input sequence are masked by so-called sentinel tokens (*a.k.a* unique mask tokens) and
  the output sequence is formed as a concatenation of the same sentinel tokens and the *real* masked tokens. Each
  sentinel token represents a unique mask token for this sentence and should start with `&amp;lt;extra_id_0>`,
  `&amp;lt;extra_id_1>`, ... up to `&amp;lt;extra_id_99>`. As a default, 100 sentinel tokens are available in
  [T5Tokenizer](/docs/transformers/master/en/model_doc/mt5#transformers.T5Tokenizer).

  For instance, the sentence "The cute dog walks in the park" with the masks put on "cute dog" and "the" should be
  processed as follows:

```
from transformers import T5Tokenizer, T5ForConditionalGeneration

tokenizer = T5Tokenizer.from_pretrained("t5-small")
model = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("t5-small")

input_ids = tokenizer('The &amp;lt;extra_id_0> walks in &amp;lt;extra_id_1> park', return_tensors='pt').input_ids
labels = tokenizer('&amp;lt;extra_id_0> cute dog &amp;lt;extra_id_1> the &amp;lt;extra_id_2>', return_tensors='pt').input_ids
# the forward function automatically creates the correct decoder_input_ids
loss = model(input_ids=input_ids, labels=labels).loss
```

  If you're interested in pre-training T5 on a new corpus, check out the [run_t5_mlm_flax.py](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/master/examples/flax/language-modeling) script in the Examples
  directory.

- Supervised training

  In this setup, the input sequence and output sequence are a standard sequence-to-sequence input-output mapping.
  Suppose that we want to fine-tune the model for translation for example, and we have a training example: the input
  sequence "The house is wonderful." and output sequence "Das Haus ist wunderbar.", then they should be prepared for
  the model as follows:

```
from transformers import T5Tokenizer, T5ForConditionalGeneration

tokenizer = T5Tokenizer.from_pretrained("t5-small")
model = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("t5-small")

input_ids = tokenizer('translate English to German: The house is wonderful.', return_tensors='pt').input_ids
labels = tokenizer('Das Haus ist wunderbar.', return_tensors='pt').input_ids
# the forward function automatically creates the correct decoder_input_ids
loss = model(input_ids=input_ids, labels=labels).loss
```

  As you can see, only 2 inputs are required for the model in order to compute a loss: `input_ids` (which are the
  `input_ids` of the encoded input sequence) and `labels` (which are the `input_ids` of the encoded
  target sequence). The model will automatically create the `decoder_input_ids` based on the `labels`, by
  shifting them one position to the right and prepending the `config.decoder_start_token_id`, which for T5 is
  equal to 0 (i.e. the id of the pad token). Also note the task prefix: we prepend the input sequence with 'translate
  English to German: ' before encoding it. This will help in improving the performance, as this task prefix was used
  during T5's pre-training.

  However, the example above only shows a single training example. In practice, one trains deep learning models in
  batches. This entails that we must pad/truncate examples to the same length. For encoder-decoder models, one
  typically defines a `max_source_length` and `max_target_length`, which determine the maximum length of the
  input and output sequences respectively (otherwise they are truncated). These should be carefully set depending on
  the task.

  In addition, we must make sure that padding token id's of the `labels` are not taken into account by the loss
  function. In PyTorch and Tensorflow, this can be done by replacing them with -100, which is the `ignore_index`
  of the `CrossEntropyLoss`. In Flax, one can use the `decoder_attention_mask` to ignore padded tokens from
  the loss (see the [Flax summarization script](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/master/examples/flax/summarization) for details). We also pass
  `attention_mask` as additional input to the model, which makes sure that padding tokens of the inputs are
  ignored. The code example below illustrates all of this.

```
from transformers import T5Tokenizer, T5ForConditionalGeneration 
import torch

tokenizer = T5Tokenizer.from_pretrained("t5-small")
model = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("t5-small")

# the following 2 hyperparameters are task-specific
max_source_length = 512
max_target_length = 128

# Suppose we have the following 2 training examples:
input_sequence_1 = "Welcome to NYC"
output_sequence_1 = "Bienvenue à NYC"

input_sequence_2 = "HuggingFace is a company"
output_sequence_2 = "HuggingFace est une entreprise"

# encode the inputs
task_prefix = "translate English to French: "
input_sequences = [input_sequence_1, input_sequence_2]
encoding = tokenizer([task_prefix + sequence for sequence in input_sequences], 
                     padding='longest', 
                     max_length=max_source_length, 
                     truncation=True, 
                     return_tensors="pt")
input_ids, attention_mask = encoding.input_ids, encoding.attention_mask

# encode the targets
target_encoding = tokenizer([output_sequence_1, output_sequence_2], 
                            padding='longest', 
                            max_length=max_target_length, 
                            truncation=True)
labels = target_encoding.input_ids

# replace padding token id's of the labels by -100
labels = [
           [(label if label != tokenizer.pad_token_id else -100) for label in labels_example] for labels_example in labels
] 
labels = torch.tensor(labels)

# forward pass
loss = model(input_ids=input_ids, attention_mask=attention_mask, labels=labels).loss
```

Additional training tips:

- T5 models need a slightly higher learning rate than the default one set in the `Trainer` when using the AdamW
  optimizer. Typically, 1e-4 and 3e-4 work well for most problems (classification, summarization, translation, question
  answering, question generation). Note that T5 was pre-trained using the AdaFactor optimizer.

- According to [this forum post](https://discuss.huggingface.co/t/t5-finetuning-tips/684), task prefixes matter when
  (1) doing multi-task training (2) your task is similar or related to one of the supervised tasks used in T5's
  pre-training mixture (see Appendix D of the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.10683.pdf) for the task prefixes
  used).

- If training on TPU, it is recommended to pad all examples of the dataset to the same length or make use of
  _pad_to_multiple_of_ to have a small number of predefined bucket sizes to fit all examples in. Dynamically padding
  batches to the longest example is not recommended on TPU as it triggers a recompilation for every batch shape that is
  encountered during training thus significantly slowing down the training. only padding up to the longest example in a
  batch) leads to very slow training on TPU.

<a id='inference'></a>

<h2 id="inference">Inference</h2>

At inference time, it is recommended to use [generate()](/docs/transformers/master/en/main_classes/model#transformers.generation_utils.GenerationMixin.generate). This
method takes care of encoding the input and feeding the encoded hidden states via cross-attention layers to the decoder
and auto-regressively generates the decoder output. Check out [this blog post](https://huggingface.co/blog/how-to-generate) to know all the details about generating text with Transformers.
There's also [this blog post](https://huggingface.co/blog/encoder-decoder#encoder-decoder) which explains how
generation works in general in encoder-decoder models.

```
from transformers import T5Tokenizer, T5ForConditionalGeneration 

tokenizer = T5Tokenizer.from_pretrained("t5-small")
model = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("t5-small")

input_ids = tokenizer('translate English to German: The house is wonderful.', return_tensors='pt').input_ids
outputs = model.generate(input_ids)
print(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True))
# Das Haus ist wunderbar.
```

Note that T5 uses the `pad_token_id` as the `decoder_start_token_id`, so when doing generation without using
[generate()](/docs/transformers/master/en/main_classes/model#transformers.generation_utils.GenerationMixin.generate), make sure you start it with the `pad_token_id`.

The example above only shows a single example. You can also do batched inference, like so:

```
from transformers import T5Tokenizer, T5ForConditionalGeneration

tokenizer = T5Tokenizer.from_pretrained("t5-small")
model = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("t5-small")

# when generating, we will use the logits of right-most token to predict the next token
# so the padding should be on the left
tokenizer.padding_side = "left" 
tokenizer.pad_token = tokenizer.eos_token # to avoid an error

task_prefix = 'translate English to German: '
sentences = ['The house is wonderful.', 'I like to work in NYC.'] # use different length sentences to test batching
inputs = tokenizer([task_prefix + sentence for sentence in sentences], return_tensors="pt", padding=True)

output_sequences = model.generate(
    input_ids=inputs['input_ids'],
    attention_mask=inputs['attention_mask'],
    do_sample=False, # disable sampling to test if batching affects output
)

print(tokenizer.batch_decode(output_sequences, skip_special_tokens=True))

# ['Das Haus ist wunderbar.', 'Ich arbeite gerne in NYC.']
```

<h2 id="example-scripts">Example scripts</h2>

T5 is supported by several example scripts, both for pre-training and fine-tuning.

- pre-training: the [run_t5_mlm_flax.py](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/master/examples/flax/language-modeling/run_t5_mlm_flax.py)
  script allows you to further pre-train T5 or pre-train T5 from scratch on your own data. The [t5_tokenizer_model.py](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/master/examples/flax/language-modeling/t5_tokenizer_model.py)
  script allows you to further train a T5 tokenizer or train a T5 Tokenizer from scratch on your own data. Note that
  Flax (a neural network library on top of JAX) is particularly useful to train on TPU hardware.

- fine-tuning: T5 is supported by the official summarization scripts ([PyTorch](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/master/examples/pytorch/summarization), [Tensorflow](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/master/examples/tensorflow/summarization), and [Flax](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/master/examples/flax/summarization)) and translation scripts
  ([PyTorch](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/master/examples/pytorch/translation) and [Tensorflow](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/master/examples/tensorflow/translation)). These scripts allow
  you to easily fine-tune T5 on custom data for summarization/translation.

This is the configuration class to store the configuration of a [T5Model](/docs/transformers/master/en/model_doc/t5#transformers.T5Model) or a
[TFT5Model](/docs/transformers/master/en/model_doc/t5#transformers.TFT5Model). It is used to instantiate a T5 model according to the specified arguments,
defining the model architecture. Instantiating a configuration with the defaults will yield a similar configuration
to that of the T5 [t5-small](https://huggingface.co/t5-small) architecture.

Configuration objects inherit from [PretrainedConfig](/docs/transformers/master/en/main_classes/configuration#transformers.PretrainedConfig) and can be used to control the model

The bare T5 Model transformer outputting raw hidden-states without any specific head on top.

The T5 model was proposed in [Exploring the Limits of Transfer Learning with a Unified Text-to-Text Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10683) by Colin Raffel, Noam Shazeer, Adam Roberts, Katherine Lee, Sharan Narang,
Michael Matena, Yanqi Zhou, Wei Li, Peter J. Liu. It's an encoder decoder transformer pre-trained in a text-to-text
denoising generative setting.

This model inherits from [PreTrainedModel](/docs/transformers/master/en/main_classes/model#transformers.PreTrainedModel). Check the superclass documentation for the generic
methods the library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input embeddings,
pruning heads etc.)

This model is also a PyTorch [torch.nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module)
subclass. Use it as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to
general usage and behavior.

  [What are decoder input IDs?](../glossary#decoder-input-ids)

  T5 uses the `pad_token_id` as the starting token for `decoder_input_ids` generation. If
  `past_key_values` is used, optionally only the last `decoder_input_ids` have to be input (see
  `past_key_values`).

  To know more on how to prepare `decoder_input_ids` for pretraining take a look at [T5 Training](./t5#training).
- **decoder_attention_mask** (`torch.BoolTensor` of shape `(batch_size, target_sequence_length)`, _optional_) --
  Default behavior: generate a tensor that ignores pad tokens in `decoder_input_ids`. Causal mask will
  also be used by default.
- **head_mask** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(num_heads,)` or `(num_layers, num_heads)`, _optional_) --
  Mask to nullify selected heads of the self-attention modules in the encoder. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:

  - 1 indicates the head is **not masked**,
  - 0 indicates the head is **masked**.

- **decoder_head_mask** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(num_heads,)` or `(num_layers, num_heads)`, _optional_) --
  Mask to nullify selected heads of the self-attention modules in the decoder. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:

  - 0 indicates the head is **masked**.

- **cross_attn_head_mask** (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(num_heads,)` or `(num_layers, num_heads)`, _optional_) --
  Mask to nullify selected heads of the cross-attention modules in the decoder. Mask values selected in
  `[0, 1]`:

  - 1 indicates the head is **not masked**,

- **encoder_outputs** (`tuple(tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`, _optional_) --
  Tuple consists of (`last_hidden_state`, `optional`: _hidden_states_, `optional`:
  _attentions_) `last_hidden_state` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)` is a
  sequence of hidden states at the output of the last layer of the encoder. Used in the cross-attention of
  the decoder.

  Contains precomputed key and value hidden states of the attention blocks. Can be used to speed up decoding.

  If `past_key_values` are used, the user can optionally input only the last `decoder_input_ids`
  (those that don't have their past key value states given to this model) of shape `(batch_size, 1)`
  instead of all `decoder_input_ids` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`.
- **inputs_embeds** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`, _optional_) --
  Optionally, instead of passing `input_ids` you can choose to directly pass an embedded representation.
  This is useful if you want more control over how to convert `input_ids` indices into associated
  vectors than the model's internal embedding lookup matrix.
- **decoder_inputs_embeds** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, target_sequence_length, hidden_size)`, _optional_) --

The [T5Model](/docs/transformers/master/en/model_doc/t5#transformers.T5Model) forward method, overrides the `__call__` special method.

<Tip>

Although the recipe for forward pass needs to be defined within this function, one should call the
`Module` instance afterwards instead of this since the former takes care of running the pre and post
processing steps while the latter silently ignores them.

</Tip>



Example:

```python
>>> from transformers import T5Tokenizer, T5Model

>>> tokenizer = T5Tokenizer.from_pretrained('t5-small')
>>> model = T5Model.from_pretrained('t5-small')

>>> input_ids = tokenizer("Studies have been shown that owning a dog is good for you", return_tensors="pt").input_ids  # Batch size 1
>>> decoder_input_ids = tokenizer("Studies show that", return_tensors="pt").input_ids  # Batch size 1

>>> # forward pass
>>> outputs = model(input_ids=input_ids, decoder_input_ids=decoder_input_ids)
>>> last_hidden_states = outputs.last_hidden_state

This is an experimental feature and is a subject to change at a moment's notice.

Uses a device map to distribute attention modules of the model across several devices. If no device map is given,
it will evenly distribute blocks across all devices.

# Here is an example of a device map on a machine with 4 GPUs using t5-3b, which has a total of 24 attention modules:
model = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained('t5-3b')
device_map = &amp;lcub;0: [0, 1, 2],

- **decoder_attention_mask** (`torch.BoolTensor` of shape `(batch_size, target_sequence_length)`, _optional_) --
  Default behavior: generate a tensor that ignores pad tokens in `decoder_input_ids`. Causal mask will
  also be used by default.
- **head_mask** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(num_heads,)` or `(num_layers, num_heads)`, _optional_) --
  Mask to nullify selected heads of the self-attention modules in the encoder. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:

  - 1 indicates the head is **not masked**,
  - 0 indicates the head is **masked**.

- **decoder_head_mask** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(num_heads,)` or `(num_layers, num_heads)`, _optional_) --
  Mask to nullify selected heads of the self-attention modules in the decoder. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:

  - 1 indicates the head is **not masked**,
  - 0 indicates the head is **masked**.

- **cross_attn_head_mask** (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(num_heads,)` or `(num_layers, num_heads)`, _optional_) --
  Mask to nullify selected heads of the cross-attention modules in the decoder. Mask values selected in
  `[0, 1]`:

  - 1 indicates the head is **not masked**,
  - 0 indicates the head is **masked**.

- **encoder_outputs** (`tuple(tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`, _optional_) --
  Tuple consists of (`last_hidden_state`, `optional`: _hidden_states_, `optional`:
  _attentions_) `last_hidden_state` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)` is a
  sequence of hidden states at the output of the last layer of the encoder. Used in the cross-attention of
  the decoder.
- **past_key_values** (`tuple(tuple(torch.FloatTensor))` of length `config.n_layers` with each tuple having 4 tensors of shape `(batch_size, num_heads, sequence_length - 1, embed_size_per_head)`) --
  Contains precomputed key and value hidden states of the attention blocks. Can be used to speed up decoding.

  If `past_key_values` are used, the user can optionally input only the last `decoder_input_ids`
  (those that don't have their past key value states given to this model) of shape `(batch_size, 1)`
  instead of all `decoder_input_ids` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`.
- **inputs_embeds** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`, _optional_) --
  Optionally, instead of passing `input_ids` you can choose to directly pass an embedded representation.
  This is useful if you want more control over how to convert `input_ids` indices into associated
  vectors than the model's internal embedding lookup matrix.
- **decoder_inputs_embeds** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, target_sequence_length, hidden_size)`, _optional_) --
  Optionally, instead of passing `decoder_input_ids` you can choose to directly pass an embedded
  representation. If `past_key_values` is used, optionally only the last `decoder_inputs_embeds`
  have to be input (see `past_key_values`). This is useful if you want more control over how to convert
  `decoder_input_ids` indices into associated vectors than the model's internal embedding lookup matrix.

  If `decoder_input_ids` and `decoder_inputs_embeds` are both unset, `decoder_inputs_embeds`
  takes the value of `inputs_embeds`.

- **use_cache** (`bool`, _optional_) --
  If set to `True`, `past_key_values` key value states are returned and can be used to speed up
  decoding (see `past_key_values`).

  Whether or not to return the attentions tensors of all attention layers. See `attentions` under returned
  tensors for more detail.
- **output_hidden_states** (`bool`, _optional_) --
  Whether or not to return the hidden states of all layers. See `hidden_states` under returned tensors for
  more detail.
- **return_dict** (`bool`, _optional_) --
  Whether or not to return a [ModelOutput](/docs/transformers/master/en/main_classes/output#transformers.file_utils.ModelOutput) instead of a plain tuple.

- **labels** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size,)`, _optional_) --
  Labels for computing the sequence classification/regression loss. Indices should be in `[-100, 0, ..., config.vocab_size - 1]`. All labels set to `-100` are ignored (masked), the loss is only computed for
  labels in `[0, ..., config.vocab_size]`</paramsdesc><paramgroups>0</paramgroups><rettype>[Seq2SeqLMOutput](/docs/transformers/master/en/main_classes/output#transformers.modeling_outputs.Seq2SeqLMOutput) or `tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`</rettype><retdesc>A [Seq2SeqLMOutput](/docs/transformers/master/en/main_classes/output#transformers.modeling_outputs.Seq2SeqLMOutput) or a tuple of

The [T5ForConditionalGeneration](/docs/transformers/master/en/model_doc/t5#transformers.T5ForConditionalGeneration) forward method, overrides the `__call__` special method.

<Tip>

Although the recipe for forward pass needs to be defined within this function, one should call the
`Module` instance afterwards instead of this since the former takes care of running the pre and post
processing steps while the latter silently ignores them.

</Tip>



Examples:

```python
>>> from transformers import T5Tokenizer, T5ForConditionalGeneration

>>> tokenizer = T5Tokenizer.from_pretrained('t5-small')
>>> model = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained('t5-small')

>>> # training
>>> input_ids = tokenizer('The &amp;lt;extra_id_0> walks in &amp;lt;extra_id_1> park', return_tensors='pt').input_ids
>>> labels = tokenizer('&amp;lt;extra_id_0> cute dog &amp;lt;extra_id_1> the &amp;lt;extra_id_2>', return_tensors='pt').input_ids
>>> outputs = model(input_ids=input_ids, labels=labels)
>>> loss = outputs.loss

>>> # inference

The bare T5 Model transformer outputting encoder's raw hidden-states without any specific head on top.

The T5 model was proposed in [Exploring the Limits of Transfer Learning with a Unified Text-to-Text Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10683) by Colin Raffel, Noam Shazeer, Adam Roberts, Katherine Lee, Sharan Narang,
Michael Matena, Yanqi Zhou, Wei Li, Peter J. Liu. It's an encoder decoder transformer pre-trained in a text-to-text
denoising generative setting.

methods the library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input embeddings,
pruning heads etc.)

This model is also a PyTorch [torch.nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module)

This model is also a [tf.keras.Model](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/Model) subclass. Use
it as a regular TF 2.0 Keras Model and refer to the TF 2.0 documentation for all matter related to general usage

<Tip>

TF 2.0 models accepts two formats as inputs:

- having all inputs as keyword arguments (like PyTorch models), or
- having all inputs as a list, tuple or dict in the first positional arguments.

This second option is useful when using `tf.keras.Model.fit` method which currently requires having all
the tensors in the first argument of the model call function: `model(inputs)`.

If you choose this second option, there are three possibilities you can use to gather all the input Tensors in
the first positional argument :

- a single Tensor with `input_ids` only and nothing else: `model(inputs_ids)`
- a list of varying length with one or several input Tensors IN THE ORDER given in the docstring:
  `model([input_ids, attention_mask])` or `model([input_ids, attention_mask, token_type_ids])`
- a dictionary with one or several input Tensors associated to the input names given in the docstring:
  `model(&amp;lcub;"input_ids": input_ids, "token_type_ids": token_type_ids})`

The [TFT5Model](/docs/transformers/master/en/model_doc/t5#transformers.TFT5Model) forward method, overrides the `__call__` special method.

<Tip>

Although the recipe for forward pass needs to be defined within this function, one should call the
`Module` instance afterwards instead of this since the former takes care of running the pre and post
processing steps while the latter silently ignores them.

</Tip>



Examples:

```python
>>> from transformers import T5Tokenizer, TFT5Model

>>> tokenizer = T5Tokenizer.from_pretrained('t5-small')
>>> model = TFT5Model.from_pretrained('t5-small')

>>> input_ids = tokenizer("Studies have been shown that owning a dog is good for you", return_tensors="tf").input_ids  # Batch size 1
>>> decoder_input_ids = tokenizer("Studies show that", return_tensors="tf").input_ids  # Batch size 1

>>> # forward pass
>>> outputs = model(input_ids, decoder_input_ids=decoder_input_ids)
>>> last_hidden_states = outputs.last_hidden_state

T5 Model with a _language modeling_ head on top. 

The T5 model was proposed in [Exploring the Limits of Transfer Learning with a Unified Text-to-Text Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10683) by Colin Raffel, Noam Shazeer, Adam Roberts, Katherine Lee, Sharan Narang,
Michael Matena, Yanqi Zhou, Wei Li, Peter J. Liu. It's an encoder decoder transformer pre-trained in a text-to-text
denoising generative setting.

This model inherits from [TFPreTrainedModel](/docs/transformers/master/en/main_classes/model#transformers.TFPreTrainedModel). Check the superclass documentation for the
generic methods the library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input
embeddings, pruning heads etc.)

This model is also a [tf.keras.Model](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/Model) subclass. Use
it as a regular TF 2.0 Keras Model and refer to the TF 2.0 documentation for all matter related to general usage
and behavior.

<Tip>

TF 2.0 models accepts two formats as inputs:

- having all inputs as keyword arguments (like PyTorch models), or
- having all inputs as a list, tuple or dict in the first positional arguments.

This second option is useful when using `tf.keras.Model.fit` method which currently requires having all
the tensors in the first argument of the model call function: `model(inputs)`.

If you choose this second option, there are three possibilities you can use to gather all the input Tensors in
the first positional argument :

- a single Tensor with `input_ids` only and nothing else: `model(inputs_ids)`
- a list of varying length with one or several input Tensors IN THE ORDER given in the docstring:
  `model([input_ids, attention_mask])` or `model([input_ids, attention_mask, token_type_ids])`
- a dictionary with one or several input Tensors associated to the input names given in the docstring:
  `model(&amp;lcub;"input_ids": input_ids, "token_type_ids": token_type_ids})`

Although the recipe for forward pass needs to be defined within this function, one should call the
`Module` instance afterwards instead of this since the former takes care of running the pre and post
processing steps while the latter silently ignores them.

  [transformers.PreTrainedTokenizer.encode()](/docs/transformers/master/en/internal/tokenization_utils#transformers.PreTrainedTokenizerBase.encode) and [transformers.PreTrainedTokenizer.__call__()](/docs/transformers/master/en/internal/tokenization_utils#transformers.PreTrainedTokenizerBase.__call__) for
  details.

  [What are decoder input IDs?](../glossary#decoder-input-ids)

  T5 uses the `pad_token_id` as the starting token for `decoder_input_ids` generation. If
  `past_key_values` is used, optionally only the last `decoder_input_ids` have to be input (see
  `past_key_values`).

  To know more on how to prepare `decoder_input_ids` for pretraining take a look at [T5 Training](./t5#training).
- **decoder_attention_mask** (`jnp.ndarray` of shape `(batch_size, target_sequence_length)`, _optional_) --
  Default behavior: generate a tensor that ignores pad tokens in `decoder_input_ids`. Causal mask will
  also be used by default.
- **encoder_outputs** (`tuple(tuple(jnp.ndarray)`, _optional_) --
  Tuple consists of (`last_hidden_state`, `optional`: _hidden_states_, `optional`:
  _attentions_) `last_hidden_state` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)` is a
  sequence of hidden states at the output of the last layer of the encoder. Used in the cross-attention of
  the decoder.
- **past_key_values** (`tuple(tuple(jnp.ndarray))` of length `config.n_layers` with each tuple having 4 tensors of shape `(batch_size, num_heads, sequence_length - 1, embed_size_per_head)`) --
  Contains precomputed key and value hidden states of the attention blocks. Can be used to speed up decoding.

  If `past_key_values` are used, the user can optionally input only the last `decoder_input_ids`
  (those that don't have their past key value states given to this model) of shape `(batch_size, 1)`
  instead of all `decoder_input_ids` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`.

  Whether or not to return the attentions tensors of all attention layers. See `attentions` under returned
  tensors for more detail.

various elements depending on the configuration ([T5Config](/docs/transformers/master/en/model_doc/t5#transformers.T5Config)) and inputs.

- **logits** (`jnp.ndarray` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, config.vocab_size)`) -- Prediction scores of the language modeling head (scores for each vocabulary token before SoftMax).

  shape `(batch_size, num_heads, sequence_length, embed_size_per_head)`) and 2 additional tensors of
  shape `(batch_size, num_heads, encoder_sequence_length, embed_size_per_head)`.

  Contains pre-computed hidden-states (key and values in the self-attention blocks and in the cross-attention
  blocks) that can be used (see `past_key_values` input) to speed up sequential decoding.
- **decoder_hidden_states** (`tuple(jnp.ndarray)`, _optional_, returned when `output_hidden_states=True` is passed or when `config.output_hidden_states=True`) -- Tuple of `jnp.ndarray` (one for the output of the embeddings + one for the output of each layer) of

The `FlaxT5PreTrainedModel` forward method, overrides the `__call__` special method.

<Tip>

Although the recipe for forward pass needs to be defined within this function, one should call the
`Module` instance afterwards instead of this since the former takes care of running the pre and post
processing steps while the latter silently ignores them.

</Tip>







Example:

```python
>>> from transformers import T5Tokenizer, FlaxT5ForConditionalGeneration

>>> tokenizer = T5Tokenizer.from_pretrained('t5-small')
>>> model = FlaxT5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained('t5-small')

>>> ARTICLE_TO_SUMMARIZE = "summarize: My friends are cool but they eat too many carbs."
>>> inputs = tokenizer([ARTICLE_TO_SUMMARIZE], return_tensors='np')

>>> # Generate Summary
>>> summary_ids = model.generate(inputs['input_ids']).sequences
>>> print(tokenizer.decode(summary_ids[0], skip_special_tokens=True, clean_up_tokenization_spaces=False))
