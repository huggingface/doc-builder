<h1 id="reformer">Reformer</h1>

**DISCLAIMER:** This model is still a work in progress, if you see something strange, file a [Github Issue](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug-report.md&title).

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

The Reformer model was proposed in the paper [Reformer: The Efficient Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04451.pdf) by Nikita Kitaev, ﾅ「kasz Kaiser, Anselm Levskaya.

The abstract from the paper is the following:

*Large Transformer models routinely achieve state-of-the-art results on a number of tasks but training these models can
be prohibitively costly, especially on long sequences. We introduce two techniques to improve the efficiency of
Transformers. For one, we replace dot-product attention by one that uses locality-sensitive hashing, changing its
complexity from O(L^2) to O(Llog(L)), where L is the length of the sequence. Furthermore, we use reversible residual
layers instead of the standard residuals, which allows storing activations only once in the training process instead of
N times, where N is the number of layers. The resulting model, the Reformer, performs on par with Transformer models
while being much more memory-efficient and much faster on long sequences.*

This model was contributed by [patrickvonplaten](https://huggingface.co/patrickvonplaten). The Authors' code can be
found [here](https://github.com/google/trax/tree/master/trax/models/reformer).

**Note**:

- Reformer does **not** work with *torch.nn.DataParallel* due to a bug in PyTorch, see [issue #36035](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/36035)

<h2 id="axial-positional-encodings">Axial Positional Encodings</h2>

Axial Positional Encodings were first implemented in Google's [trax library](https://github.com/google/trax/blob/4d99ad4965bab1deba227539758d59f0df0fef48/trax/layers/research/position_encodings.py#L29)
and developed by the authors of this model's paper. In models that are treating very long input sequences, the
conventional position id encodings store an embedings vector of size \\(d\\) being the `config.hidden_size` for
every position \\(i, \ldots, n_s\\), with \\(n_s\\) being `config.max_embedding_size`. This means that having
a sequence length of \\(n_s = 2^&amp;lcub;19} \approx 0.5M\\) and a `config.hidden_size` of \\(d = 2^&amp;lcub;10} \approx 1000\\)
would result in a position encoding matrix:

$$X_&amp;lcub;i,j}, \text&amp;lcub; with } i \in \left[1,\ldots, d\right] \text&amp;lcub; and } j \in \left[1,\ldots, n_s\right]$$

which alone has over 500M parameters to store. Axial positional encodings factorize \\(X_&amp;lcub;i,j}\\) into two matrices:

$$X^&amp;lcub;1}_&amp;lcub;i,j}, \text&amp;lcub; with } i \in \left[1,\ldots, d^1\right] \text&amp;lcub; and } j \in \left[1,\ldots, n_s^1\right]$$

and

$$X^&amp;lcub;2}_&amp;lcub;i,j}, \text&amp;lcub; with } i \in \left[1,\ldots, d^2\right] \text&amp;lcub; and } j \in \left[1,\ldots, n_s^2\right]$$

with:

$$d = d^1 + d^2 \text&amp;lcub; and } n_s = n_s^1 \times n_s^2 .$$

Therefore the following holds:

$$X_&amp;lcub;i,j} = \begin&amp;lcub;cases}
X^&amp;lcub;1}_&amp;lcub;i, k}, & \text&amp;lcub;if }\ i &amp;lt; d^1 \text&amp;lcub; with } k = j \mod n_s^1 \\
X^&amp;lcub;2}_&amp;lcub;i - d^1, l}, & \text&amp;lcub;if } i \ge d^1 \text&amp;lcub; with } l = \lfloor\frac&amp;lcub;j}&amp;lcub;n_s^1}\rfloor
\end&amp;lcub;cases}$$

Intuitively, this means that a position embedding vector \\(x_j \in \mathbb&amp;lcub;R}^&amp;lcub;d}\\) is now the composition of two
factorized embedding vectors: \\(x^1_&amp;lcub;k, l} + x^2_&amp;lcub;l, k}\\), where as the `config.max_embedding_size` dimension
\\(j\\) is factorized into \\(k \text&amp;lcub; and } l\\). This design ensures that each position embedding vector
\\(x_j\\) is unique.

Using the above example again, axial position encoding with \\(d^1 = 2^5, d^2 = 2^5, n_s^1 = 2^9, n_s^2 = 2^&amp;lcub;10}\\)
can drastically reduced the number of parameters to \\(2^&amp;lcub;14} + 2^&amp;lcub;15} \approx 49000\\) parameters.

In practice, the parameter `config.axial_pos_embds_dim` is set to a tuple \\((d^1, d^2)\\) which sum has to be
equal to `config.hidden_size` and `config.axial_pos_shape` is set to a tuple \\((n_s^1, n_s^2)\\) which
product has to be equal to `config.max_embedding_size`, which during training has to be equal to the *sequence
length* of the `input_ids`.


<h2 id="lsh-self-attention">LSH Self Attention</h2>

In Locality sensitive hashing (LSH) self attention the key and query projection weights are tied. Therefore, the key
query embedding vectors are also tied. LSH self attention uses the locality sensitive hashing mechanism proposed in
[Practical and Optimal LSH for Angular Distance](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.02897) to assign each of the tied key
query embedding vectors to one of `config.num_buckets` possible buckets. The premise is that the more "similar"
key query embedding vectors (in terms of *cosine similarity*) are to each other, the more likely they are assigned to
the same bucket.

The accuracy of the LSH mechanism can be improved by increasing `config.num_hashes` or directly the argument
`num_hashes` of the forward function so that the output of the LSH self attention better approximates the output
of the "normal" full self attention. The buckets are then sorted and chunked into query key embedding vector chunks
each of length `config.lsh_chunk_length`. For each chunk, the query embedding vectors attend to its key vectors
(which are tied to themselves) and to the key embedding vectors of `config.lsh_num_chunks_before` previous
neighboring chunks and `config.lsh_num_chunks_after` following neighboring chunks.

For more information, see the [original Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04451) or this great [blog post](https://www.pragmatic.ml/reformer-deep-dive/).

Note that `config.num_buckets` can also be factorized into a list \\((n_&amp;lcub;\text&amp;lcub;buckets}}^1,
n_&amp;lcub;\text&amp;lcub;buckets}}^2)\\). This way instead of assigning the query key embedding vectors to one of \\((1,\ldots,
n_&amp;lcub;\text&amp;lcub;buckets}})\\) they are assigned to one of \\((1-1,\ldots, n_&amp;lcub;\text&amp;lcub;buckets}}^1-1, \ldots,
1-n_&amp;lcub;\text&amp;lcub;buckets}}^2, \ldots, n_&amp;lcub;\text&amp;lcub;buckets}}^1-n_&amp;lcub;\text&amp;lcub;buckets}}^2)\\). This is crucial for very long sequences to
save memory.

When training a model from scratch, it is recommended to leave `config.num_buckets=None`, so that depending on the
sequence length a good value for `num_buckets` is calculated on the fly. This value will then automatically be
saved in the config and should be reused for inference.

Using LSH self attention, the memory and time complexity of the query-key matmul operation can be reduced from
\\(\mathcal&amp;lcub;O}(n_s \times n_s)\\) to \\(\mathcal&amp;lcub;O}(n_s \times \log(n_s))\\), which usually represents the memory
and time bottleneck in a transformer model, with \\(n_s\\) being the sequence length.


<h2 id="local-self-attention">Local Self Attention</h2>

Local self attention is essentially a "normal" self attention layer with key, query and value projections, but is
chunked so that in each chunk of length `config.local_chunk_length` the query embedding vectors only attends to
the key embedding vectors in its chunk and to the key embedding vectors of `config.local_num_chunks_before`
previous neighboring chunks and `config.local_num_chunks_after` following neighboring chunks.

Using Local self attention, the memory and time complexity of the query-key matmul operation can be reduced from
\\(\mathcal&amp;lcub;O}(n_s \times n_s)\\) to \\(\mathcal&amp;lcub;O}(n_s \times \log(n_s))\\), which usually represents the memory
and time bottleneck in a transformer model, with \\(n_s\\) being the sequence length.


<h2 id="training">Training</h2>

During training, we must ensure that the sequence length is set to a value that can be divided by the least common
multiple of `config.lsh_chunk_length` and `config.local_chunk_length` and that the parameters of the Axial
Positional Encodings are correctly set as described above. Reformer is very memory efficient so that the model can
easily be trained on sequences as long as 64000 tokens.

For training, the [ReformerModelWithLMHead](/docs/transformers/master/en/model_doc/reformer#transformers.ReformerModelWithLMHead) should be used as follows:

```python
input_ids = tokenizer.encode("This is a sentence from the training data", return_tensors="pt")
loss = model(input_ids, labels=input_ids)[0]
```

Reformer was proposed in [Reformer: The Efficient Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04451) by Nikita Kitaev,
ﾅ「kasz Kaiser, Anselm Levskaya.

This model inherits from [PreTrainedModel](/docs/transformers/master/en/main_classes/model#transformers.PreTrainedModel). Check the superclass documentation for the generic methods the
library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input embeddings, pruning heads
etc.)

This model is also a PyTorch [torch.nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module) subclass.
Use it as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to general usage
and behavior.

  [What are input IDs?](../glossary#input-ids)
- **attention_mask** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, *optional*) --
  Mask to avoid performing attention on padding token indices. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:

  - 1 for tokens that are **not masked**,
  - 0 for tokens that are **masked**.

  [What are attention masks?](../glossary#attention-mask)
- **position_ids** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, *optional*) --

  [What are position IDs?](../glossary#position-ids)
- **head_mask** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(num_heads,)` or `(num_layers, num_heads)`, *optional*) --
  Mask to nullify selected heads of the self-attention modules. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:

  - 1 indicates the head is **not masked**,
  - 0 indicates the head is **masked**.

- **inputs_embeds** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`, *optional*) --
  Optionally, instead of passing `input_ids` you can choose to directly pass an embedded representation. This
  is useful if you want more control over how to convert `input_ids` indices into associated vectors than the
  model's internal embedding lookup matrix.
- **num_hashes** (`int`, *optional*) --
  The number of hashing rounds that should be performed during bucketing. Setting this argument overwrites

Although the recipe for forward pass needs to be defined within this function, one should call the `Module`
instance afterwards instead of this since the former takes care of running the pre and post processing steps while
the latter silently ignores them.

  Indices of input sequence tokens in the vocabulary. During training the input_ids sequence_length has to be
  a multiple of the relevant model's chunk lengths (lsh's, local's or both). During evaluation, the indices
  are automatically padded to be a multiple of the chunk length.

  Indices can be obtained using [ReformerTokenizer](/docs/transformers/master/en/model_doc/reformer#transformers.ReformerTokenizer). See [PreTrainedTokenizer.encode()](/docs/transformers/master/en/internal/tokenization_utils#transformers.PreTrainedTokenizerBase.encode) and

  [What are input IDs?](../glossary#input-ids)
- **attention_mask** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, *optional*) --
  Mask to avoid performing attention on padding token indices. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:

  - 1 for tokens that are **not masked**,
  - 0 for tokens that are **masked**.

  [What are attention masks?](../glossary#attention-mask)

  [What are position IDs?](../glossary#position-ids)
- **head_mask** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(num_heads,)` or `(num_layers, num_heads)`, *optional*) --

- **inputs_embeds** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`, *optional*) --
  Optionally, instead of passing `input_ids` you can choose to directly pass an embedded representation. This
  is useful if you want more control over how to convert `input_ids` indices into associated vectors than the
  model's internal embedding lookup matrix.
- **num_hashes** (`int`, *optional*) --
  The number of hashing rounds that should be performed during bucketing. Setting this argument overwrites
  the default defined in `config.num_hashes`.

  second being the previous *hidden_states* of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`).

  Contains precomputed hidden-states and buckets (only relevant for LSH Self-Attention). Can be used to speed

  Whether or not to return the attentions tensors of all attention layers. See `attentions` under returned

- **labels** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size,)`, *optional*) --
  Labels for computing the sequence classification/regression loss. Indices should be in `[0, ...,
  config.num_labels - 1]`. If `config.num_labels == 1` a regression loss is computed (Mean-Square loss), If

The [ReformerForSequenceClassification](/docs/transformers/master/en/model_doc/reformer#transformers.ReformerForSequenceClassification) forward method, overrides the `__call__` special method.

<Tip>

Although the recipe for forward pass needs to be defined within this function, one should call the `Module`
instance afterwards instead of this since the former takes care of running the pre and post processing steps while
the latter silently ignores them.

Example of single-label classification:

```python
>>> from transformers import ReformerTokenizer, ReformerForSequenceClassification
>>> import torch

>>> tokenizer = ReformerTokenizer.from_pretrained("google/reformer-crime-and-punishment")
>>> model = ReformerForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("google/reformer-crime-and-punishment")

>>> inputs = tokenizer("Hello, my dog is cute", return_tensors="pt")
>>> labels = torch.tensor([1]).unsqueeze(0)  # Batch size 1
>>> outputs = model(**inputs, labels=labels)
>>> loss = outputs.loss
>>> logits = outputs.logits
```

Example of multi-label classification:

```python
>>> from transformers import ReformerTokenizer, ReformerForSequenceClassification
>>> import torch

>>> tokenizer = ReformerTokenizer.from_pretrained("google/reformer-crime-and-punishment")
>>> model = ReformerForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("google/reformer-crime-and-punishment", problem_type="multi_label_classification")

>>> inputs = tokenizer("Hello, my dog is cute", return_tensors="pt")
>>> labels = torch.tensor([[1, 1]], dtype=torch.float)  # need dtype=float for BCEWithLogitsLoss
>>> outputs = model(**inputs, labels=labels)
>>> loss = outputs.loss
>>> logits = outputs.logits

Reformer Model with a span classification head on top for extractive question-answering tasks like SQuAD / TriviaQA
( a linear layer on top of hidden-states output to compute `span start logits` and `span end logits`.

Reformer was proposed in [Reformer: The Efficient Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04451) by Nikita Kitaev,
ﾅ「kasz Kaiser, Anselm Levskaya.

This model inherits from [PreTrainedModel](/docs/transformers/master/en/main_classes/model#transformers.PreTrainedModel). Check the superclass documentation for the generic methods the
library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input embeddings, pruning heads
etc.)

This model is also a PyTorch [torch.nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module) subclass.
Use it as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to general usage
and behavior.
